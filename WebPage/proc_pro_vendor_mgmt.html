                        organization since external spend (CapEx and OpEx) constitutes a major
                        component of the cost basis for NaaS Operators. For this reason, strengthening
                        procurement capabilities is necessary to support rapid and cost-effective
                        network deployment. Procurement management ensures that the NaaS Operator
                        effectively identifies, sources and manages vendors for the business to reach
                        its strategic goals and objectives. </p>

                        procurement and purchasing activities to acquire products and services from
                        selected vendors. Development and maintenance of relationships with on-boarded
                        vendors is essential to maximize the value received from them. Vendor
                        management process helps to achieve these goals by evaluating vendors
                        capabilities, managing contracts, assessing risks and evaluating their
                        performance.</p>

                        new deployments can be very much dependent on the specific region and/or

                        in emerging markets and areas where there is still a significant percentage of
                        unconnected population, where CapEx is mostly focused on the rollout of new mobile
                        network infrastructure, upgrading networks to 4G technology and investing in

                    <p class="normal-text">The sourcing cycle starts with the NaaS Operator identifying
                    a need for a product or service. Depending on the type of need, different
                    departments in the NaaS Operator organization will be involved. It will be
                    necessary to gather information from all the involved stakeholders and assess
                    the business necessity and business case for the specific product or service.</p>

                    <p class="normal-text">Within the procurement strategy, the NaaS Operator will
                    consider the type of vendor that will be used to fulfill the delivery of the
                    required product or service. This can include exploring both local vendors as
                    well as larger international vendors. The objective is to select the vendors
                    that can provide the most cost-effective and efficient service.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Once the type of vendor that is more suitable for the
                    specific initiative has been decided, the sourcing team will initiate the
                    tendering process. The tendering process will allow the NaaS Operator to obtain
                    and evaluate proposals submitted from invited companies in response to the
                    requirements provided by the NaaS Operator.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">At this point, it will be necessary to create the relevant
                    documentation that will be sent for tender. The documentation will include
                    product or service requirements, terms and conditions, purchase volumes and
                    service level agreements. This documentation will be used during the RFx
                    Process as it allows vendors to quote accordingly to fulfill these
                    requirements.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">RFx processes will provide the NaaS Operator with the
                    opportunity to gain relevant information from vendors, including size,
                    financials and availability of qualified resources. Including a Request for
                    Information (RFI) or a Vendor qualification process within the procurement
                    procedure will help the NaaS Operator to determine whether a vendor meets the
                    criteria to be included in the tender process.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">After initial qualification has been performed, Request for
                    Proposals (RFP) or Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be sent out to the

                    <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>

                        regularly during a valid contract period. The NaaS Operator will negotiate
                        longer-term pricing and conditions with the vendor and record them in the
                        contract.<br>
                        Individual release orders will be submitted afterward,
                        specifying the order quantity and the delivery date.</li>
                    
                        <li>
                        Long-term scheduling agreements.<br>
                        If the product or service is ordered on a regular basis and
                        is delivered according to a time schedule specified with the vendor in a
                        project plan. The products or services to be delivered are specified in the
                        scheduling agreement. <br>
                        Under this type of agreement, the NaaS Operator will create
                        a delivery schedule plan with individual scheduled deliverables specifying
                        exact quantities, delivery dates, and times extending over a certain period

                    <p class="normal-text">Besides the form of agreement, the NaaS Operator will also
                    consider different alternatives for the type of contracts to formalize such
                    agreements. The following list is meant to provide guidelines to the NaaS
                    Operator about the usual type of contracts:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
                        <li>Fixed Price Contracts: </li>
                        <br>Fixed Price contracts will be used by the NaaS
                        Operator when the scope is perfectly defined. In this case, both the NaaS
                        Operator and the vendor understand how much time and resources are needed to
                        complete the project.<br><br>
                        Some variations exist for the Fixed Price
                        Contracts:</br>
                    
                        <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
                            <li style="font-size: 16px;">Firm Fixed Price contract (FFP).<br>
                            In this case, the NaaS Operator will pay the price
                            specified in the contract, regardless of the cost incurred by the vendor.</li>
                    
                            <li style="font-size: 16px;">Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment contract (FP-EPA).<br>
                            In this case, the vendor is allowed to adjust the price of
                            the contract based on economic factors outside the control of the NaaS Operator
                            and the vendor.<br><br>
                            These factors will, of course, be predefined and agreed
                            between both parties before the contract is signed. An example of this type of
                            factor can be the currency or interest rate of the country.<br><br>
                            This type of contract is typically used for fixed price
                            contracts that span through multiple years.</li>
                    
                            <li style="font-size: 16px;">Fixed Price Incentive Fee contract (FPIF). <br>
                            In this case, the NaaS Operator and the vendor will agree
                            on performance incentives during negotiations, and if the vendor is able to
                            meet the required performance objectives, they will be paid a bonus. On the
                            other side, the FPIF can also include a negative incentive if the vendor is
                            unable to meet the performance standards. In an FPIF contract, the final price
                            is calculated after all the work has been completed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                    
                    <li>Cost reimbursable contracts<br>
                    In cost reimbursable
                    contracts, the NaaS Operator will reimburse the vendor for all eligible costs
                    plus a fee, which represents the vendors profits. Cost reimbursable contracts
                    are used when the scope is not fully defined at the start of the project. If
                    there is an unanticipated cost overrun, the NaaS Operator is responsible for
                    covering that cost. The risks in cost reimbursable contracts are on the buyer
                    side.<br><br>
                    Some variations include the following:<br>
                    
                        <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
                            <li style="font-size: 16px;">Cost plus fixed fee contract (CPFF): It is the most
                            straightforward. The NaaS Operator will reimburse the vendor for all allowable
                            costs plus a predetermined fee, which represents the vendors profits.</li>

                            Cost plus award fee contract (CPAF): In
                            this case, the NaaS Operator reimburses the vendor for all allowable costs and
                            additional award based on a set of subjective factors.</li>
                            
                            <li style="font-size: 16px;">
                            Cost plus incentive fee contract
                            (CPIF): In CPIF, the NaaS Operator will reimburse the vendor for all allowable
                            costs plus an incentive fee determined based on some predefined performance
                            criteria (usually cost-related).</li>

                    <li>
                    Time and Material Contracts (T&amp;M)<br>
                    In a T&amp;M contract, the unit cost of labor
                    or material is fixed, but the number of units is flexible. For example, the
                    contract will set a consultants rate to be $100/hour, but the number of hours
                    the consultant works on the project may vary.<br>
                    A T&amp;M contract is a hybrid between a fixed
                    price contract and a cost reimbursable contract. This type of contract is used
                    when the scope is not precisely defined, and there is a high probability of
                    changes to the scope.
                    <br>In a T&amp;M contract, the NaaS Operator and
                    the vendor share the risk of the contract. The NaaS operator knows the
                    predetermined rates of the resources, and the vendor can claim extra units
                    delivered if the scope increases.</li>

                    costs, the definition of controls around spending and the implementation of

                        opportunities for savings/cost reduction. Spend Data is necessary for sourcing
                        teams to better understand the spend at a detailed level and then propose
                        savings opportunities. Savings opportunities can be possible in different
                        categories such as Vendor consolidation, standardizing contracts across
                        locations, payment terms review, etc.<br><br>
                        Saving opportunities will need to be

                        savings potential can be performed by the NaaS Operators internal industry
                        experience, by accessing available industry benchmarks or by engaging with
                        industry experts. Required effort will depend on the complexity of the sourcing
                        events that are required (quick quotations versus long RFP processes).<br>
                        Once the potential of the opportunities has
                        been assessed, it will be possible to prioritize them and start negotiations
                        with new vendors or renegotiate existing contracts with current vendors.</li><br>
                    
                        <li>Spend Forecasting<br>
                        Being able to forecast spend is a major benefit
                        of spend analysis activity. Different groups in the NaaS organization can use
                        the spend data to forecast future spending. Finance and Planning can use spend
                        data to analyze recurring vendor spend as well as to forecast expenditure
                        budgets in next years for long-term contracts. Sourcing teams can work with
                        NaaS Operator departments to forecast upcoming spend for their main vendors.<br><br>
                        Spend analysis requires accessing all systems
                        inside the NaaS Operators organization where the source spend data resides.
                        This may include multiple accounting and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
                        systems. As it will be reviewed in section 6, a powerful purchasing software
                        will allow not only the automation of the purchasing process, but also to
                        facilitate cost control and granular visibility into the spend.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">For Spend data analysis, there are Business Intelligence and
                    reporting tools that allow to load the data and identify trends based on the
                    specific objectives of the analysis.</p>

                    <p class="normal-text">Purchasing is a sub-process of procurement that is related
                    to the transactional phase of the procurement process activities. These
                    transactional activities between the NaaS Operator and the vendors are
                    necessary to procure the products and services itemized in the contracts with
                    the vendors. </p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">The activities in the purchasing process include:</p>

                    <p class="normal-text">As described in the following sections, it is critical that
                    throughout the process the NaaS Operator applies a 2-way or 3-way matching of
                    Purchase Orders with the vendor invoices. This means that the quantity billed
                    must be less than or equal to the quantity ordered (1<sup>st</sup> way); the
                    invoice price must be less than or equal to the purchase order price (2<sup>nd</sup>
                    way); and the quantity billed must be less than or equal to the quantity
                    received (3<sup>rd</sup> way). Performing this verification is important to
                    reduce errors and keep both the NaaS Operator and vendor accountable.</p>

                    Purchase Requests</a></h2>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Purchasing process starts with a purchase requisition or
                    purchase request form (PRF). PRF is a document that is created by the
                    person/department requesting the products or services and is usually submitted
                    to the department that controls finances. </p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">A purchase requisition is the formal request for permission
                    to purchase the product or services that the internal NaaS department requires.
                    Obtaining the approval is the first step of the process and will allow later
                    efficient audits of the purchasing activities. </p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">In the case of tender processes conducted throughout an RFx
                    (RFP/RFQ) process, the need for the products and/or services will be supported
                    by a business case and the approval process will require an in-depth review
                    involving multi-department management or even C-level management.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Purchase requests will usually include the following
                    information: identification of the requesting department, quantity and
                    description of products or services requested, the identification of the
                    vendor, the price and the corresponding delivery times for the products and/or
                    services.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">For this objective, the NaaS Operator can adapt and use the provided
                    <a href="https://github.com/teleworxllc/NaaSRunBook/tree/gh-pages/Supply%20Chain%20Management/Templates/Purchase%Request%Form%Template.xlsx" class="a_link">Purchase Request

                    <p class="normal-text">Once the NaaS procurement or purchasing group gets the
                    approval for the purchase requisition, it will create and issue a Purchase
                    Order to the vendor. Purchase Orders generally include the name of the NaaS
                    Operator (i.e. company purchasing the products or services), the description
                    and quantity of the requested products and/or services, price, payment information
                    and terms, invoice address and a Purchase Order number.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">The Purchase Orders are also an important document for the
                    vendors, which will use them for invoicing purposes. Once the delivery of the
                    requested products and/or services is completed, the vendor will send an
                    invoice associated to the PO to be paid by the purchaser.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">There are many possible ways to handle the creation and
                    monitoring of purchase requisitions and purchase orders. As it will be
                    discussed in more detail in section 6 (Procurement Management Software), the
                    most efficient way can consist of specific procurement software that is
                    integrated with other financial systems. Using procurement management software
                    platforms instead of Excel templates and email communication to create, share,
                    and track purchasing documents can generate important reduction in costs and
                    allow a much tighter<a>control over NaaS Operator spend</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Purchase requests and purchase orders are the main documents
                    that facilitate the management of costs and inventory. These documents support
                    the NaaS organization to clarify important transactional details, stay
                    protected against financial audits, and protect both purchasers and vendors.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">To this extent, the NaaS Operator can consider the

                    <p class="normal-text">Quality inspection is important to assure the quality of
                    received products and services. Quality inspection will consist of checking,
                    measuring, or testing of one or more product or service characteristics to
                    confirm compliance to requirements.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">For material products included in the transaction with the
                    Vendor, it is recommended that received products are inspected for completeness
                    and integrity, to allow the NaaS Operator to detect any deficiencies or
                    differences with the requested products indicated in the Purchase Order.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Quality inspection also applies in the case of received
                    services and therefore highlights the importance of a clear definition of the deliverables
                    expected as a result of the execution of the services. Thus, acceptance
                    protocols and tests need to be established during the selection of vendors and
                    negotiation to have a common framework and understanding of the expected
                    results.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">In many occasions, the NaaS Operator will have a relation
                    with the Vendor that has been achieved after a tender process using a RFx
                    procedure. In these cases, the contract that is signed with the vendor is
                    managed by the NaaS Operators procurement, financial and legal staff (contract
                    management). Review, Approval, and Payment all rely on complete, accurate, and
                    on-time fulfillment of the contract. Once the contract terms are confirmed,
                    including acceptance of deliverables, payment to the vendor will be made.</p>

                    <p class="normal-text">The Invoice Verification activity completes the
                    transactional procurement process and includes checking the accuracy of
                    received invoices with respect to the price stipulated in the Purchase Order.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">There are different types of Invoice Verification:</p>

                        order can be settled together, regardless of whether or not an item has been
                        received in several partial deliveries. All the deliveries are totaled and
                        posted as one item.</li>
                        
                        <li>
                        Invoices based on Goods Receipt: With
                        goods receipt-based Invoice Verification, each individual goods receipt is
                        invoiced separately.</li>
                        
                        <li>
                        Invoices without an order reference:
                        Most purchasing automation solutions will
                        allow the verification of an invoice when there is no reference to a PO, by
                        posting the transaction directly to a Material Account, a General Ledger (G/L)
                        Account, or an Asset Account.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">As described in this document, purchasing transactional
                    activities will usually be performed through a Procurement management software

                    provision of products and services to improve and maximize business
                    performance. Vendors form an indispensable and critical part of the NaaS

                    <p class="normal-text">The success of the NaaS Operator business is founded on
                    fulfilling the value of the commitments that are captured in the contacts with
                    the vendors. For this reason, it is important to dimension the resources and
                    efforts for a proper contract management.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">As highlighted in Figure 9 and described in this section, a
                    contract typically passes through several stages during its lifetime: from
                    initiation and negotiation to execution and start-up, through the operational
                    period, and then to renewal or close-out.</p>

                            periodically checking for any circumstantial changes that could affect the
                            contracts ability to deliver the expected benefits.</li>

                            These changes may require updates to
                            the contract, or to the expectations, processes or behavior of the vendor or
                            the NaaS operator.

                                consequent opportunities for improvement, are typically discovered by a survey
                                of some key direct and indirect users of the vendor products or services.</li>
                    
                                <li style="font-size: 16px;">The survey should be conducted as often
                                as necessary to ensure that low satisfaction is detected and effectively
                                addressed before irreparable relationship or business damage is caused.</li>

                        risks that can potentially occur over a period.<br>
                        The risk
                        register should be comprehensive enough to capture potential threats that may
                        affect the NaaS organization. For all identified risks, it will be convenient
                        to create worst-case scenarios and a business-impact analysis. Risk probability
                        scores and risk impact scores will help raise the red-flags followed by
                        corrective and timely executive actions.</li>
                    
                        <li>Risk Transfer: This
                        option can become key in those cases where a vendor failure can lead to
                        significant business impact. Risk transfer involves the use of insurance that
                        partially transfers the responsibility of the risk back to the vendor.
                        Transferring risk increases pressure on the vendor to maintain the quality of
                        products and services delivered.</li>
                    
                        <li>
                        Use of Automated solutions for
                        assessing and mitigating risks. These automated solutions facilitate the
                        identification of partners, processes, and practices that are risky and help
                        ensure that the Naas Operator is as immune as possible to any unwanted vendor-related
                        issues. <br>
                        Automation can help identify the most vulnerable vendors
                        through ongoing reviews, audits, and performance analysis. As described in
                        section 6, one of the main use cases of Procurement Management Software is to
                        perform Vendor Management. These solutions contain functionalities to record financial

                        <li>Vendor Performance Management<br>

                        continuously monitor and manage vendor associated risks.<br>
                        This can be achieved by means of a vendor selection process
                        that includes a strict selection criterion and considers backup vendors.
                        Maintaining an extensive database of vendors, regularly updated and qualified,
                        including a comprehensive detailed analysis of active vendors can help to
                        identify vendors prone to higher risk and classify them based on the extent of
                        the threat they represent.</li>

                        schema and identifying spend patterns.<br>
                        The end-users are usually
                        the sourcing teams who use this data to identify saving opportunities, but this
                        granular visibility also helps executive management to get a granular view into
                        the spend.</li>

                    Operator in the process of selecting a procurement software platform for the
                    organization:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
                        <li><b>Integration with existing systems: </b>NaaS Operator will check the compatibility of the selected
                        software platform with the existing IT infrastructure and will analyze
                        requirements of any additional installations or upgrades for the new software
                        to be operational. The selected software will be easy to integrate with existing
                        applications, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or supply chain
                        management (SCM) software. Smooth integration with these existing systems will
                        allow the incorporation of business structures and data already in place, such
                        as workflows, vendor details and catalog information.</li>

                        <li>
                        <b>Cloud-based:</b> benefits associated with cloud-based architecture,

                        spend, vendor performance, etc. This will help businesses to obtain meaningful
                        insights from current procurement data and make fact-based procurement
                        decisions.</li>

                        Important also to check if the vendor provides any training manuals or
                        instruction videos to train the NaaS Operator on usage of the software.</li>
