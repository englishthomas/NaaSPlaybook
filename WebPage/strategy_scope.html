    Introduction</a></a></h1>
    
    <p class="normal-text">A Strategy &amp;
    Scope Definition plays a critical role for NaaS operators as it defines the
    strategic goals as well as the strategic decisions to achieve them. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The Strategy
    &amp; Scope definition is fundamental in the NaaS operator initiative as it
    provides a sense of direction and outlines measurable goals. Through an optimal
    definition of these aspects, the leadership team can ensure alignment on the
    scope and priorities towards fulfilment of the strategic objectives.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">This module
    guides the NaaS operator through an overview of the Strategy &amp; Scope
    fundamentals and the imperative of its optimal definition and implementation.
    Furthermore, it provides an Implementation Process that can be tailored to
    translate the NaaS operator mission and vision into strategic objectives that
    can be tracked. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The main outputs
    of this module are the Strategies Definition for critical aspects of the Naas
    operator. These strategies direct the decisions on subsequent modules in order
    to align them with the high-level objectives. Complementary outputs are, among
    others, the Mission &amp; Scope Definition and the Tracking Methodologies to
    evaluate the implementation of the defined strategies. </p>
    
    <br><h2 class="titulo-h2"><a>1.1
    Module Objectives</a></a></h2>
    
    <p class="normal-text">This module will
    enable the NaaS Operator to define the Strategy &amp; Scope of the NaaS
    initiative. The specific objectives of this module are to:</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">1.
    Provide procedures to enable NaaS operator to
    perform a self-assessment analysis based on an examination of the particular
    environment and market.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">2.
    Guide the NaaS operator to clarify the
    high-level scope by defining its own tailored mission and service definition.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">3.
    Instruct the NaaS operator in the strategy and
    long-term objectives definition to guide decisions in downstream activities. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">4.
    Provide methodologies to control and manage the
    defined strategiesï¿½ implementation and updates.</p>
    
    <br><h2 class="titulo-h2"><a>1.2
    Module Framework</a></a></h2>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The Module Framework in Figure 1
    describes the structure, interactions and dependencies among different NaaS
    operator areas. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Strategic Plan &amp; Scope is the
    first stream to build the NaaS operator. The modules in this stream aim to
    drive strategic decisions that impact all the downstream streams and modules.
    From this point, High Level Network Architecture can be defined establishing
    the guidelines for Network Design which in turn kick-starts the deployment
    phase. </p>

    <p align=center><i>Figure 2. Module Process View</i></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The rest of the
    module is divided into five sections. Section 2 is a birdï¿½s-eye view of the
    Strategy &amp; Scope Fundamentals as well as a high-level view of their
    development process. Section 3 focuses on the procedures to examine the
    particular environment and market. Section 4 describes processes to define the
    NaaS operatorï¿½s mission and scope. Then in section 5, methodologies to generate
    the overall strategies and long-term objectives are provided. Finally, Section
    6 includes procedures to control and manage the implementation and updates of
    the defined strategies.</p>

    Strategy &amp; Scope Fundamentals</a></a></h1>
    
    <p class="normal-text">This section
    presents a general overview of the baseline concepts to develop the NaaS
    Initiative Strategy &amp; Scope.</p>
    
    <br><h2 class="titulo-h2"><a>2.1
    Strategy &amp; Scope
    Imperative</a> </a></h2>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The Strategy
    &amp; Scope of the NaaS operator is the process of an organization deciding
    their corporate direction, objectives and priorities, and then aligning their
    resources to accomplish the actions necessary to meet them.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The main outcome
    of the Strategy &amp; Scope module is the Strategy definition around certain
    critical areas within the NaaS operator. The Strategies will guide the decision
    of subsequent phases (e.g. Network Design and Deployment). This means that the
    Network Design and Deployment streams use the strategic decisions of this
    module to generate its own processes. For this reason, Strategy &amp; Scope is
    the first step to build the NaaS operator.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Additional
    outputs from this module are Organization Strategies and Long-Term Strategic Objectives.
    These outputs are the starting point and provide a general guide for the
    High-Level Project Plan, which aims to answer how the Strategy and Objectives
    will be achieved and who must do what to accomplish them.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Finally, as
    stated before, the Strategy &amp; Scope module establishes the direction of the
    NaaS operator, including the financial resources, so it maintains a
    relationship with the Financial Plan. In other words, the Financial Plan
    outlines the allocation of financial resources to reach the broad goals set out
    in strategic planning. However, the Financial Plan is out of the scope of this
    module.</p>

    3. Strategy &amp; Scope Definition Process</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The first step,
    ï¿½Research &amp; Analysis,ï¿½ provides the methodologies to analyze the conditions
    of different environments that the NaaS operator is subject to. This
    information can be collected via web research on the operating environment and
    telecom-industry environment reports. The survey application on customers is
    also a common practice. The primary outcome of this process is the SWOT
    analysis. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The next step,
    ï¿½Mission and Scope,ï¿½ addresses the ï¿½whatï¿½ (mission) and ï¿½where does the NaaS
    operator want to be in the long termï¿½ (vision) of the NaaS operator. The
    definition of these elements is an essential part to building the strategic
    foundation and developing a strategy. Based on these elements, the competitive
    advantages can be identified. An additional step for the NaaS operator, is to
    define the technologies and services that will be part of its catalog. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The ï¿½Strategy
    Designï¿½ step contains the methodologies to develop the strategies around
    different NaaS operator areas. These strategies guide the decisions on
    subsequent modules. Furthermore, it provides the methods to transform these
    strategies into realistic goals. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Finally, the
    ï¿½Governanceï¿½ step provides guidance to move a strategic plan from a document
    that sits on the shelf to actions that drive organizational growth.</p>

    and market.</p>
    
    <br><h2 class="titulo-h2"><a>3.1
    Strategic Issues &amp; Risk Identification</a></a></h2>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Strategic issues are critical unknowns that need to be resolved by
    the strategic planning process. These issues can be problems, opportunities,
    market shifts or anything else requiring special consideration by the NaaS
    operator.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Strategic issues are developed and identified based on input from
    the leadership team. These issues should be a summary of critical topics that
    need to be addressed during the planning process. The idea is to call these
    issues out early, so the important areas are not lost among a lot of data,
    details, and ideas.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In the NaaS operator context, some strategic issues can be:</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    How to fund the NaaS
    operator initiative?</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    What are the options to
    acquire the radio spectrum?</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    What does the organization
    look like?</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">After identifying the Strategic Issues, they need to be recorded
    into the <a>$$link_widget$$Strategy
    &amp; Scope Definition Template</a> as they will be used for the
    Strategies definition.</p>
    
    <br><h2 class="titulo-h2"><a>3.2
    Operating Environmental Scan</a></a></h2>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The environmental conditions have a significant impact on the
    direction of the NaaS operator. Since the environment is prone to continuous
    changes, the organizations that are not aware of their business environments
    are likely to fail. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The environmental scan is the process of identifying, collecting and
    evaluating information about elements that are external influences on the NaaS
    operator. This process helps in a greater understanding of environmental
    changes and guides decisions on the NaaS operatorï¿½s strategic direction.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The environmental factors impacting the strategic planning can be
    grouped into two broad categories: the Operating Environment and the Telecom
    Industry Environment as shown in Figure 4. This section focuses on analyzing
    the distinct aspects regarding the Operational Environment. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><img
    border=0 width=307 height=303 id=image3.png

    <p align=center><i>Figure 4. Environment Factors Diagram</i></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">More details regarding the specific elements within each category in
    Figure 4 are provided in the following subsections.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The operating environment, which indirectly affects the NaaS
    operator comprises Political, Economic, Social and Technological factors. Thus,
    the operating environment scan is also named as PEST analysis and is part of
    the Strategy &amp; Scope process. The result of the Operating Environment Scan
    must be recorded into the <a>$$link_widget$$Strategy
    &amp; Scope Definition Template</a> as it will be used on the SWOT
    Analysis. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Political (includes legal and regulatory)</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Includes the political-legal factors comprising
    the countryï¿½s laws and regulations that can influence
    the NaaS operator objectives and operations. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>National Spectrum
    Regulation:</u></i><u> </u>The local Telecommunications Regulatory Entity
    establishes the opportunities for the spectrum to be used by the NaaS operator.<u> </u></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>National trade
    agreements</u></i>: Nowadays, there
    is a greater tendency towards international and regional trade agreements,
    which enables the access of different vendors and suppliers of varied origins
    to a common marketplace. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Privatization and
    Deregulation</u></i>: The NaaS
    operator must identify and evaluate the level of government control in the
    telecommunication market as it can impose some restrictions and limitations. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Legal Compliance</u></i>: Apart from the common labor and employment
    laws, there might potentially exist other laws and licenses that are essential
    to be complied with (e.g. telemarketing and privacy laws).</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>National Security</u></i>: Another potential source of political
    constraints for the telecom sector is the measurements that the local
    government imposes to monitor and control communications. This could impose
    additional requirements in the architecture definition.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Economic</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The role of economic factors is important in the
    context of the telecom industry. NaaS operators should account for the national economy, including
    inflation rates, interest rates, and most importantly, disposable income. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Interest rates,
    inflation and taxes</u></i>: These
    metrics affect the overall
    NaaS operatorï¿½s operation directly and, therefore, the pricing per plan offered
    to customers. Furthermore, the inflation and currency rates coud impact the
    Capital Expenditure (CapEx) if certain equipment is imported. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Income levels</u></i>: The demand for telecommunications services
    such as mobile phones and Internet can be influenced by disposable income
    levels. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Social</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Social factors
    have a profound influence on the telecommunications industry and its
    profitability. This is because it has a direct impact on the number and type of
    services demanded by users. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Demographics</u></i>: Demographic factors (e.g. age, gender, family
    size) helps to identify consumer behavior and determine the demand for products
    and services. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Lifestyle</u></i>: The use of Internet-based services has
    expanded as a higher number of people are using social media (e.g. Facebook,
    YouTube). These services require good connectivity that can only be satisfied
    with 4G coverage. Furthermore, the availability of 4G mobile devices (i.e.
    device penetration) must be identified. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Technological</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The telecommunications industry is highly
    dependent on technology changes. The NaaS operator should gain most of these
    technological trends. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>New Telecom Trends</u></i>: NaaS operators must be aware of raising technologies that can potentially
    leverage its planning and operation. For instance, disaggregated hardware or
    cloud-based solutions can reduce the expenditures on the network deployment. Moreover,
    5G radio technology can potentially increase the transmission rates. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>End-devices Evolution</u></i>: The emergence of advanced end-devices such as
    tablets and smartphones, drive the requirement of 4G connectivity. Moreover,
    several other devices will utilize a connection like biometrics, whose use on
    smartphones is expected to grow.</p>

    Telecom Industry Environment Scan</a></a></h2>
    
    <p class="normal-text">As shown in
    Figure 4, the NaaS operator must be aware of the Telecom Industry Environment.
    This section provides general guidelines to collect information about
    customers, competitors, and other market variables to generate insights for
    strategiesï¿½ definition. </p>
    
    <h3 style='margin-left:35.45pt'><a>3.3.1
    Telecom Conditions Evaluation</a> </h3>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Suppliers Environment</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">A part of the Environmental Analysis is the evaluation of the
    available suppliers and their effect on the environment. The NaaS operator
    supplierï¿½s environment is mainly composed of the following elements: </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Network equipment
    providers: </u></i>The available
    network equipment providers and the cost to the NaaS operator must be analyzed.
    Furthermore, it is fundamental that the examined vendors offer Proven
    Technology and provide evidence of their equipment in production. Some of the
    providers will require international transportation to the NaaS operator
    region, which may potentially increase the cost and delivery time. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Service Providers:</u></i> The different service providers with coverage
    in the NaaS operator region must be examined. These providers include among others Transport Providers and
    Fiber / Tower Companies. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Workforce, or
    suppliers of labor: </u></i>This
    element is affected by the availability of a qualified and experienced
    telecommunications sector workforce and also by the consolidation in the
    regional labor market.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The information regarding suppliersï¿½ environment can be collected by
    performing a research on the web sites of the different suppliers. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Geographic Conditions</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">An analysis regarding the terrain conditions must be conducted,
    especially in rural areas. The specific geographic features (e.g. mountains,
    dense forest) may significantly complicate the network deployment for remote
    populations as the access to the site for construction and maintenance may
    complicate. Furthermore, harsh climates (e.g. extreme hot or cold) can make the
    operation and maintenance tasks of the site more challenging. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">This analysis has a direct impact on the subsequent design and
    deployment phases as often extensive microwave or fiber optic laying must be
    required in the transport network. If the terrestrial solutions are not
    feasible, NaaS operators often have to rely on satellite transport with
    additional expensive bandwidth fees to connect remote areas. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In addition to the terrain, the climate can also have a significant
    impact on the satellite signals as these are vulnerable to rain conditions that
    can occur regularly in tropical areas. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In further deployment phases, it is important to perform a Technical
    Site Survey (TSS) on each site to clearly define the geographic conditions.ï¿½ </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Basic Infrastructure</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The network deployment in rural and remote locations is directly
    impacted by a lack of basic infrastructure (e.g. power grid, road access). If
    adverse conditions are presented, the Naas operator must build each site in a
    self-sufficient manner (e.g. solar energy-based). This represents an increment
    in the deployment costs and subsequent operations and maintenance costs. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Furthermore, the quality of the basic infrastructure must be
    identified as bad quality infrastructure may represents additional costs on the
    site operations (e.g. bad quality power grid may require backup batteries). </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The Technical Site Survey (TSS) on each site in further deployment
    phases clearly defines the existing basic infrastructure conditions. </p>
    
    <h3 style='margin-left:35.45pt'><a>3.3.2
    Customer Segmentation and Targeting</a></h3>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The NaaS operator should recognize that all customers have to be
    approached in different ways as their needs and values are different. Rather
    than trying to compete in the entire market, the NaaS operator must identify
    parts of the market that can be served best and most profitably.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The most effective way to achieve this is to segment customers. The
    goal of creating customer segments is so that specific customers that have
    similar needs can be targeted with the same products and pricing. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The following questions can help to identify the target Customer
    Segments: </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    What is the biggest customer
    segment?</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    Do customers fall into any
    logical segments based on needs, or characteristics?</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    Are there one or two
    characteristics that will help to segment customers? (Geography, price, need,
    etc.)</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In the context of NaaS operator environment, the potential customers
    are: </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Mobile Network
    Operators (MNOs):</u></i> An MNO
    with no 4G coverage in the desired area using its own granted spectrum or via
    roaming agreements and the network infrastructure of the NaaS operator.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Mobile Virtual Network
    Operator (MVNOs): </u></i>Virtual
    operators that can offer mobile services by using the network services of the
    NaaS operator.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Wireless Internet
    service provider (WISP)</u></i>:
    These operators can extend its coverage area by using its own granted spectrum
    and the network infrastructure of the NaaS operator.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>End-users</u></i>: These are end-users subscribers that directly
    buy LTE services from the NaaS operator. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Once segments are identified, the NaaS operator must determine its
    particular needs and the most appropriate way to satisfy them by providing
    value. The following process illustrates the process to perform customer
    segmentation.</p>
    
    <ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>

    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    Can the size of the segment
    be measured? </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    Can this segment be reached
    through clear communication channels?</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    Are there enough customers
    in the segment to make it profitable?</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    Will this segment respond
    differently to product and service offerings than other segments identified?</p>

    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    Per consumption level:
    stratified per consumption unit (traffic volumes, number of subscribers) </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    Per geographic zone:
    stratified per geographic area. </p>
    
    <h3 style='margin-left:35.45pt'><a>3.3.3
    Competitive Analysis</a> </h3>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The competitive analysis aims to assess the opportunities and
    threats that may occur from those organizations competing for the same
    business. The NaaS operator needs to have an understanding of what competitors
    are or arenï¿½t offering the same service to potential customers. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Unless explicitly stated, along this document the term ï¿½customerï¿½
    refers to entities that buy services directly from the NaaS operator (e.g.
    MNOs, MVNOs). In contrast, ï¿½end-userï¿½ term refers to subscribers that use the
    LTE services. It is important to mention that not all the end-users buy
    services directly from the NaaS operator, as some of them will buy the service
    from an MVNO. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In order to identify the organizations that compete for the same
    customers, the following actions must be performed: </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    Make a list of similar
    organizations by name or group. What are each oneï¿½s strengths and weaknesses?</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    Are these opportunities or
    threats to the NaaS operator?</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    What are the competitive
    advantages of similar organizations?</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    What is happening with these
    similar organizations? Are they growing or shrinking?</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The following subsections examine different types of organizations
    that compete for the same group of customers as NaaS operators. They can be
    divided into two main groups: Direct competitors and Substitute Products.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Direct Competitors</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In the NaaS operator context, the direct competitors are:</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Mobile Network
    Operators:</u></i> An MNO with a
    well-established existing network represents a competitor for the NaaS operator. An MNO is also a
    direct competitor when rural areas are part of their expansion plan.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Wireless Internet
    service provider (WISP)</u></i>:
    These operators provide Internet services at designated hot spots (access
    points) using a wireless connection such as Wi-Fi or provide fixed wireless to
    end customersï¿½ homes and business. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Substitute Products</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">A substitute product performs the same or a similar function as the
    NaaS operator offer but by different means. Substitutes offer the greatest
    threat when they can provide customers with better service at lower costs
    through changes that improve the value of their products or services.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In the NaaS operator context, the main substitute products can be in
    the form of:</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Wireline providers: </u></i>Traditional wireline providers that offer
    Internet and voice service via cable and digital subscriber lines (DSL).
    However, these types of
    providers do not have great penetration in
    rural areas. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Satellite internet
    providers:</u></i> Providers that
    offer Internet access via satellite link. Although these operators provide
    great coverage in rural areas, the high installation and operational costs
    translate into expensive user fees.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In order to quantify the specific threat of substitute products, it
    is essential to look at the price-performance trade-off between the substitute
    and the NaaS operator services. </p>

    <h3 style='margin-left:35.45pt'><a>3.4.1
    Identify Opportunities and Threats</a> </h3>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Opportunities are situations that potentially exist but must be
    acted on so to benefit the NaaS operator. Most relevant opportunities are those
    that offer important avenues for profitable growth, those where a company has
    the most potential for competitive development, and those that match up well
    with the financial and organizational resource capabilities that the company
    already possesses or can acquire.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In contrast, Threats refer to external conditions or barriers that
    may prevent the NaaS operator from reaching its objectives.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The areas presented in Table 1 can help to identify opportunities
    and threats that can be identified using the results of the Operating and

    Identify Strengths and Weaknesses</a> </h3>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Strengths refer to the areas (e.g., operations, management, marketing)
    in which the NaaS operator performs successfully. An analysis of organization
    strengths should be market and customer-focused because strengths are only
    meaningful when they assist in meeting customer needs. Strengths give the
    organization enhanced competitiveness.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">On the other hand, Weaknesses refer to any limitations that the NaaS
    operator faces in developing or implementing a Strategy. A weakness is
    something an organization lacks or does poorly in comparison to others, or a
    condition that puts it at a disadvantage. Weaknesses should also be examined
    from a customer perspective because customers often perceive weaknesses that an
    organization cannot see.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The strengths and weaknesses can be discovered via brainstorming
    process among the elements of the leadership team and by breaking them down in
    the areas presented in Table 2.</p>

    SWOT Development</a> </h3>
    
    <p class="normal-text">A SWOT analysis is a methodology to examine an organization by
    looking at the internal strengths and weaknesses in relation to external
    opportunities and threats. This analysis takes as an input all the previous
    analysis (i.e. Operating and Telecom Industry Environmental Scan, Customer
    Segmentation, Competitive Analysis). By creating a SWOT analysis, all the
    important factors affecting the organization can be seen together in one place.
    Itï¿½s easy to read, easy to communicate, and easy to create.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The following list considers some questions to be asked during the
    development of the SWOT. These questions should have been already answered in
    the analysis prior to the SWOT development: </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">&#9679;
    Strengths: What do you do
    well (in sales, marketing, operations, management)? What are your assets? What
    are your core competencies? What differentiates you from your competitors? Why
    do customers want to buy from you?</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">&#9679;
    Weaknesses:ï¿½ Where do you
    lack resources? What can you do better? What necessary expertise do you
    currently lack? In what areas do your competitors have an edge?</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">&#9679;
    Opportunities: What new
    needs of customers could you meet? What are the economic trends that benefit
    you? What are the emerging political and social opportunities? What are the
    technological breakthroughs? What niches have your competitors missed?</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">&#9679;
    Threats: Where are the red
    alerts in your environment? What are the negative economic trends? What are the
    negative political and social trends? Where are you vulnerable?</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Once the SWOT Analysis is completed, the information should be used
    to start the development of strategies that will leverage the NaaS operatorï¿½s
    strengths to pursue opportunities, while also countering identified weaknesses
    and threats that might undermine its efforts. The SWOT analysis is a crucial
    input to develop strategic alternatives and potential goals.</p>

    Mission and Scope</a></a></h1>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The content of
    this section illustrates the procedures to establish a charter by defining the
    particular mission, vision and service definition for the NaaS Initiative.</p>
    
    <br><h2 class="titulo-h2"><a>4.1
    Mission Statement Development</a></a></h2>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The mission statement
    is a declaration of the NaaS operatorï¿½s purpose and spotlights the customer
    needs that are endeavoring to be met. To build a solid foundation for a
    successful organization, it is essential to have a written, clear, concise, and
    consistent mission statement that simply explains the NaaS operatorï¿½s purpose. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The mission
    statement should serve as a guide for day-to-day operations and as the
    foundation for future decision-making. The following guidelines should be
    considered when writing or evaluating the mission statement: </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Focuses on satisfying
    customer needs</u></i>: a mission statement should focus on satisfying customer
    needs rather than on a program or service. It states ï¿½whoï¿½ are the customers,
    ï¿½whatï¿½ needs the NaaS operators aim to satisfy and ï¿½howï¿½ those needs are satisfied.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Based on core
    competencies</u></i>: NaaS operators should base its mission on a
    competitively superior internal strength, unique capability or resource that
    the organization performs well in comparison to similar operators.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Realistic</u></i>: The mission statement should be realistic,
    avoiding making the mission too narrow or too broad.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Specific, short,
    sharply focused and memorable</u></i>:
    It should be a precise statement of purpose that describes the essence of the
    organization in words that
    customers and stakeholders can remember. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Clear and easily
    understood</u></i>: Develop and
    write the mission statement in a way that it can effectively express the NaaS
    operator purpose. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Additionally,
    the Naas operator can use the <a>$$link_widget$$Mission
    Statement Assessment Checklist</a> to assess the
    above criteria on the developed mission statement.</p>
    
    <br><h2 class="titulo-h2"><a>4.2
    Vision Statement Development</a></a></h2>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The vision
    statement provides a clear mental picture of what will the NaaS operator look
    like in 5 to 10 years from now. Forming a strategic vision should provide
    long-term direction, delineate the organizational activities to be pursued and
    the capabilities the NaaS operator plans to develop. It serves as a unifying
    focal point for everyone in the Organization. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">An effective
    vision statement consists of the following elements. The specific vision
    statement generated by the NaaS operator may nor incorporate all these
    elements, but they must be considered when casting the statement:</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Future casting</u></i>: Provides a picture of what
    will the NaaS operator look like in the future.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Purpose-Driven</u></i>: It should be appropriately worded to give
    internal staff a sense of purpose within the NaaS operator. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Capitalizes on Core
    competencies: </u></i>It builds on
    strengths, and unique capabilities, resources and assets. </p>
    
    <br><h2 class="titulo-h2"><a>4.3
    Identify Competitive Advantages</a></a></h2>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The competitive
    advantage is what the NaaS operator does or potentially could do better than
    similar organizations. One result of a well-developed and executed strategic
    plan is to develop a unique competitive advantage. A sustainable competitive
    advantage(s) is the foundation, the cornerstone of the strategy.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The following
    criteria must be considered to evaluate the Competitive Advantage
    identification: </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Consistent difference</u></i>: Customers must perceive a consistent
    difference between the NaaS operator services and those of its competitors.
    This difference needs to be obvious to customers, and it must influence their
    purchasing decision.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Difficult to imitate</u></i>: A good competitive advantage must be difficult
    to imitate. This might be in the form of people, proprietary knowledge within
    the organization, or business processes that are behind the scenes.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Constantly improved</u></i>: The first two bulleted items above must create
    activities that can be constantly nurtured and improved upon in order to
    maintain an edge over the competition.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Some examples of
    competitive advantage in the NaaS operator context are:</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    Be the only operator which
    offers mobile broadband data services in the region.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½

    <h3 style='margin-left:35.45pt'><a>4.4.1
    Radio Technologies</a></h3>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE)</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">4G LTE is a
    wireless communications standard developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership
    Project (3GPP) and it is reflective of the coverage consumers now expect. LTE
    delivers the ability to use end devices to their peak functionality.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><u>The
    recommendation is that LTE must always be the default technology to be deployed
    by NaaS operators.</u> </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Pre-Existing 3G (UMTS)ï¿½ / 2G (GSM)
    Network</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The rural areas
    may have coverage with legacy technologies (e.g. 3G UMTS and 2G GSM) provided
    by some existing MNOs. However, these technologies are not capable of
    supporting todayï¿½s user requirements.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">It is not
    recommended to deploy 3G equipment as the use of this technology will be
    declining in the coming years. However, in case of deployment of 3G equipment,
    the NaaS operator must ensure that it can be depreciated while still being
    used.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><u>The
    recommendation is that 3G and 2G technologies should not be deployed and only
    be considered for CS Fallback capabilities. </u></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>5G Radio Technology </u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The fifth-generation
    (5G) of cellular technology increases the speed and responsiveness of wireless
    networks. Over this network, data can be transmitted at multi-gigabit speeds,
    with potential peaks of 20Gbps. Moreover, it offers a latency of 1ms that
    enable real-time applications. 5G will also increase the available bandwidth
    due to advance antenna technology implementation.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Despite all the
    advertised capabilities, 5G deployments have not been massively implemented as
    the technology and equipment standards are still in process of development.ï¿½ </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><u>The
    recommendation is that 5G radio technology should not be deployed in the NaaS
    operator network until successful tests are successfully completed in NaaS
    operator laboratories or flagship rural deployments. ï¿½</u></p>
    
    <h3 style='margin-left:35.45pt'><a>4.4.2
    Voice Services</a></h3>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The NaaS
    operator must evaluate if Voice Services will be part of its catalog of
    services as it represents special considerations in the network architecture.
    It can select to only provide data services for their customers. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">If the NaaS
    operator wants to offer voice services as part of its catalog service, there
    are three available options that are described in the following subsections.
    Further details on the implementation of these alternatives are provided in the
    Mobile Core Architecture module.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Circuit Switched FallBack (CSFB)</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In this
    scenario, the LTE handset falls back to 3G or 2G to establish a traditional
    circuit switching connection. As CSFB is not strictly an LTE based voice
    service, rather EPC assists the device to fall back to a 2G/3G network. It
    presents many drawbacks such as, higher call-setup-delay or just acceptable
    quality voice. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">However, if the
    NaaS operator has a pre-existing 2G/3G network then the CSFB functionality must
    always be deployed for simplicity. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Voice over
    internet protocol (VoIP) / Over the top (OTT) Application</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">VoIP is the
    transmission of voice and multimedia content over Internet Protocol (IP)
    networks. This service is also referred as Over-the-top (OTT) Application and PoC
    (Push-to-Talk over Cellular). These type of applications can be free (e.g.
    WhatsApp, Facebook) or be provided by the VoIP service provider. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½VoIP is the
    recommended alternative when the NaaS operator wants to provide voice services
    through its 4G-only network and has budget limitations. However, it should be
    noted that the voice quality will never match VoLTE. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Voice over
    LTE (VoLTE)</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">VoLTE is the
    industry-recognized solution for providing a packet voice service over IP via
    LTE access technology. When the NaaS operator has the economical/knowledge capabilities
    and agreements with an IMS network provider, then the option that will deliver
    HD voice is VoLTE.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Furthermore,
    NaaS operators should consider the availability of VoLTE-capable devices on its
    market and the feasibility of VoLTE business case with its customers. Additionally,
    the customer (e.g. MNO) need to support VoLTE. </p>

    Organization-Wide Strategies Definition</a></a></h2>
    
    <p class="normal-text">An organization-wide strategy is a general statement(s) that guides
    and covers a set of activities. It answers the question ï¿½howï¿½. By consistently
    executing an organization-wide strategy, the NaaS operator can provide a
    product or service thatï¿½s better than its competition.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In this step of the planning process, the synthesized information in
    the SWOT analysis, the mission, vision and competitive advantages are used to
    develop the organization-wide strategy or strategies that will guide goal and
    action planning.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The following elements summarize the core of strategy and should be
    accomplished in the definition of an organization-wide strategy:</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Diagnosis of the
    situation</u></i>: A good strategic
    diagnosis does more than explain the situation; it also defines the domain of
    action. This can be accomplished during the SWOT process.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Guide decisions:</u></i> A good strategy directs and constrains action
    without fully defining its containment. It tackles the obstacles identified in
    the diagnosis by creating or drawing upon sources of advantage. This is the
    intended outcome during this phase of the planning process.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Design of coherent,
    coordinated action</u></i>: Goals
    and actions at various levels of the organization are developed in concert with
    the guiding strategy. These elements are developed in the subsequent phases.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">There are certain areas within the
    NaaS operator that require the definition of a strategy that guides the
    decision of subsequent phases. These areas are presented in Figure 5 and are
    examined in the following subsections.</p>

    methods to deploy the network. There are different strategies for funding
    telecommunication projects that are presented in Figure 6. NaaS operators must
    evaluate which of them will be used to fund the initiative. The final decision
    must consider, among other elements, the applicable political and regulatory
    conditions and it must be recorded in the <a>$$link_widget$$Strategy

    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Self-financing</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Most of the
    time, self-financing method is only applicable when the NaaS operator already
    has an existing network in the country. In this way, the costs of infrastructure
    can be reduced as existing towers and fiber can be used to support the
    deployment of the 4G network. Furthermore, the profits from the existing
    network can be used to build out the new network deployment.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In case that the
    cost of deployment exceeds the NaaS operatorï¿½s financial capabilities, an
    alternative method must be evaluated. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Telecom subsidies</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">An alternative
    option is to apply for telecom subsidies in the region. A definition of a
    subsidy is a grant or a monetary gift, usually given from the government to a
    specific project. Another form of subsidies is that the government reduces the
    taxes for a company that needs assistance; thereby they get more financial
    resources.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Joint
    venture loans</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Joint venture
    loans are an option when the loan for the investment cannot be covered for one
    single company. This means that two or more companies share the risks and
    benefits of the loan.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Joint ventures
    can result in an effective partnership, but to make this happen, they must be
    structured. To ensure this, it is recommended that an independent president is
    chosen.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">A joint venture
    often ends when the predetermined goal has been reached (e.g. the deployment
    completion) so all involved parties need to be prepared for that.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Public-Private
    Partnership</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">This partnership
    means that the private and public sectors share the risk for the project. If
    there is any risk that they together cannot control, the public sector usually
    takes responsibility for that risk.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Principally a
    public-private partnership is a form of privatization, but with a big
    difference that the public sector is also involved. The partnership is
    involving the government and one or more private sector companies. </p>

    Operator Engagement Strategy</a></h3>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The traditional
    approach of network deployment, where each operator builds its own network
    infrastructure is not efficient in rural markets with low population density.
    In turn, the NaaS operator must analyze ways to co-operate with other operators
    on expanding network coverage whilst preserving healthy competition in service
    provision. In this way, an MNO can become a partner for the NaaS operator. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The Operator
    Engagement has multiple dimensions in the sense that include elements of the
    Spectrum, Commercial and Infrastructure Strategies. These elements are examined
    in its corresponding section, but the final definitions must be consolidated in
    an Operator Engagement Package in order to present them to the operators. </p>
    
    <p align=center>Figure 7
    illustrates different alternatives to perform the Operator Engagement. The NaaS
    operator must evaluate them and select the most appropriate according to its
    conditions. The final decision must be recorded in the <a>$$link_widget$$Strategy
    &amp; Scope Definition Template</a>. </p>

    <p align=center><i>Figure 7. Operator Engagement Strategy
    Alternatives</i></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The following
    subsections describe the way to engage different types of operators as well as
    their impact on the NaaS operator strategy. It must be noted that the decision
    of the operators to be considered to interconnect with, has a direct impact on
    the RAN and Mobile Core implementation. </p>
    
    <h4><a>5.1.2.1
    Mobile Network Operators (MNO)</a></h4>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The primary
    driver that an existing Mobile Network Operator can consider to set an
    agreement with the NaaS operator is to extend its coverage to rural scenarios.
    For this, the scenarios in the following subsections can be implemented. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The impact on
    the NaaS operatorï¿½s Radio Access Network and Mobile Core implementation are
    further detailed in the respective Architecture Modules.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Network Roaming Agreements</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In this scenario, NaaS Operator owns the RAN and the core
    network and redirects the traffic to MNOï¿½s core networks. Additionally, the
    user might have to enable roaming on their phone to access the NaaS network.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">This scenario
    for the NaaS operator implies that a complete RAN and transport infrastructure
    must be deployed using its own spectrum. Additionally, the Mobile Core must
    also be implemented along with the interconnection to MNOï¿½s Mobile Core.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>RAN Sharing Agreements</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">NaaS Operator
    can provide its RAN infrastructure to multiple MNOs based on different RAN
    Sharing schemes (e.g. Multi-Operator RAN,
    Multi-Operator Core Network). In this scenario, a pool of radio spectrum is
    formed using the available sources (e.g. NaaS operator, MNO). In addition, MNOs
    rely on the NaaS radio/transport infrastructure to provide service to
    the end user. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">This scenario
    for the NaaS operator implies that a complete RAN and transport infrastructure
    must be deployed and its radio spectrum (if existing) can be used to conform
    the pool of spectrum. </p>
    
    <h4><a>5.1.2.2
    Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO)</a></h4>
    
    <p class="normal-text">A Mobile Virtual
    Network Operator (MVNO) is a virtual operator that offers mobile services under
    its trademark by using network services from a third-party mobile operator. The
    MVNOs can be further classified in different categories according to their
    characteristics.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The impact on
    the NaaS operatorï¿½s Mobile Core implementation are further detailed in the
    Architecture Module.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Full-MVNO</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In this
    scenario, the NaaS operator just provides the access network infrastructure
    and, sometimes, part of the core network. Therefore, the MVNO must build and
    maintain its own Mobile Core. As a result, the MVNO manages its own customer
    base and associated services independently from the host operator.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">This scenario
    for the NaaS operator implies that a complete RAN and transport infrastructure
    must be deployed. In addition, the NaaS operator must possess granted radio
    spectrum. Finally, the interconnection to MNOï¿½s Mobile Core needs to be
    implemented.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Light-MVNO or Re-seller</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The MVNO just
    provides its brand and its distribution channels. In contrast, the NaaS
    operator provides the access and transport, as well as the mobile service. This
    is the model that requires the lowest investment from the MVNO, therefore the
    fastest to implement.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">A Light-MVNO
    delegates the networkï¿½s operational management to its host operator, in order
    to focus on customer relations.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">This scenario
    for the NaaS operator implies that a complete RAN and transport infrastructure
    must be deployed. . In addition, the NaaS operator must possess granted radio
    spectrum. Finally, a complete Mobile Core must also be implemented.</p>

    Spectrum Strategy</a></h3>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Efficient
    spectrum management has an important impact on the quality and reach of
    affordable mobile services. Figure 8 displays the different alternatives to
    obtain and manage the radio spectrum.The NaaS operator must evaluate each
    alternative and select the most appropriate according to its conditions. The
    final decision must be recorded in the <a>$$link_widget$$Strategy

    <p align=center><i>Figure 8. Spectrum Strategy Alternatives</i></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The following subsections examine different
    approaches to obtain and manage the radio spectrum.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">It should be
    noted that a spectrum license should also be considered for transport microwave
    equipment. However, microwave spectrum considerations are deeply analyzed in
    the Transport &amp; IP Architecture module.</p>
    
    <h4><a>5.1.3.1
    Own Spectrum</a></h4>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The first
    alternative is that the NaaS operator manages and operates its own granted
    spectrum. The following subsections examine different alternatives to achieve
    this. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Re-farming
    </u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">If the NaaS
    operator has an existing operating mobile network, it can use the already
    licensed spectrum to deploy LTE services. Existing low-frequency spectrum (e.g.
    900MHz) used for 2G/3G services can be more effectively reused for 4G service
    deployment.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Spectrum re-farming is a cost-effective way to increase
    capacity in existing networks without the need to bid for new spectrum and by
    reutilizing infrastructure to overlay LTE.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Standard
    Licensed spectrum</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The NaaS
    operator can follow the standard licensed mechanisms to acquire sufficient
    spectrum to provide broadband mobile services.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">However, the
    cost of the spectrum fee may impact the overall business case. Additionally,
    the process of acquiring spectrum is highly time-consuming given its
    complexity. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Rural
    Licensed spectrum</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Spectrum
    regulators have been encouraged to clear the 700 MHz and 800 MHz spectrum
    through the migration to digital television, which can release the so-called
    ï¿½digital dividendï¿½ spectrum for use by mobile services, especially in rural
    areas. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Furthermore, in
    some countries, the local government provides specific telecom subsidies and
    grants to these types of radio bands in order to promote the coverage expansion
    in rural areas. The NaaS operator can analyze its applicability to these
    special programs. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Unlicensed
    Spectrum</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The utilization
    of unlicensed spectrum in the 5GHz range allows an operator to deploy LTE
    services without the necessity of a license for spectrum. However, the use of
    unlicensed spectrum imposes transmission power limitations, which limits the
    coverage area. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In addition, the
    NaaS Operator needs to verify if other operations are using unlicensed spectrum
    in the area, as this may cause a considerable amount of interference. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The NaaS
    Operator must be aware that the operation of LTE in unlicensed spectrum may not
    be supported by all user devices.</p>
    
    <h4><a>5.1.3.2
    3<sup>rd</sup> Party Spectrum</a></h4>
    
    <p class="normal-text">NaaS operators
    can use a 3<sup>rd</sup> party spectrum assigned to provide LTE services. The
    following subsections examine different options to accomplish this.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>MNO
    Spectrum</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">NaaS Operators
    can use the MNO granted spectrum to provide LTE services via different RAN
    Sharing schemes (e.g. Multi-Operator RAN,
    Multi-Operator Core Network).ï¿½ In this scenario, the spectrum of the MNO is
    used and, in some cases, shared.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">This scenario imposes some special considerations on the
    overall network architecture that need to be taken into account and are further
    explored in the Transport and IP Architecture Module. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Spectrum
    Leasing</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">NaaS operators
    can lease the spectrum from a third party (e.g. MNO, WISP) in order to provide
    LTE services. This represents an additional recurrent cost to NaaS operators
    that may impact the overall deployment business case. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In addition, an
    accurate capacity forecast analysis must be performed in order to determine the
    amount of bandwidth to lease. If this is not well-forecasted, the NaaS operator
    may over or underutilize the leased bandwidth. </p>
    
    <h3 style='margin-left:35.45pt'><a>5.1.4
    Commercial Strategy</a></h3>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The commercial
    strategy of the NaaS operator is composed of two elements: Revenue Strategy and
    Marketing Strategy. Figure 9 displays the different alternatives related to the
    Commercial Strategy. The NaaS operator must evaluate each alternative and
    select the most appropriate according to its conditions. The final decision
    must be recorded in the <a>$$link_widget$$Strategy
    &amp; Scope Definition Template</a>.</p>

    <p align=center><i>Figure 9. Commercial Strategy
    Alternatives</i></p>
    
    <h4><a>5.1.4.1
    Revenue</a></h4>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The Revenue
    Strategy must identify Revenue Streams within the NaaS operator environment.
    The nature of each of the streams is different, so a specific Pricing
    Strategies are required for each of them. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The applicable pricing strategies in the
    context of the NaaS operator are: </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Fixed Fee: </u></i>In this case, the NaaS operator charges a
    recurrent fixed fee for providing the services to the 3<sup>rd</sup> party
    independently of the service consumption. The recommended frequency to perform
    this activity is on a monthly
    basis. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Traffic-based:</u></i><u> </u>The
    NaaS operator can bill according to the generated traffic by the 3<sup>rd</sup>
    party subscribers. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Subscribers-based:</u> </i>Alternatively,
    in the Light-MVNO scenario, the charged fee can vary according to the number of
    subscribers to be supported by the NaaS operator network independently on the
    specific user behavior.<i> </i></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In this way, the
    different Revenue Streams can be classified accordingly. Table 3 displays a
    typical Revenue Streams classification for a NaaS Operator. </p>

    Deployment Strategy</a></h3>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The commercial
    strategy of the NaaS operator comprises two aspects: the Logistics &amp; Warehousing
    and the Infrastructure strategy. Figure 10 displays the different alternatives
    related to the Logistics &amp; Warehousing Strategy. The NaaS operator must
    evaluate each alternative and select the most appropriate according to its
    conditions. The final decision must be recorded in the <a>$$link_widget$$Strategy
    &amp; Scope Definition Template</a>.</p>

    <h4><a>5.1.5.1
    Logistics &amp; Warehousing</a></h4>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Logistic &amp;
    Warehousing describes the form in which all the network equipment and
    ancillaries are stored and distributed. The possible alternatives to implement
    these services are described in the following subsections.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Self-Managed Services</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">One alternative
    to perform the Logistics and Warehousing services is that the NaaS operator
    implements them with its own resources and facilities. This option is only
    applicable if the NaaS operator already has an existing implementation of these
    services or if it possesses enough resources to implement them. Another case
    that fits this strategy is for small NaaS Operators with no more than a handful
    of sites as little space to store equipment is required.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The
    implementation of this option requires an additional design phase if the
    Logistics &amp; Warehousing services are not already deployed. Furthermore, it
    may represent additional costs such as Warehouse rent of space and specialized
    Management Systems. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">More details on
    the processes related to Logistics &amp; Warehousing design and implementation
    are included as part of the Logistics &amp; Warehousing Module. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>3<sup>rd</sup> Party Managed Services</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Another option
    for the NaaS operator consists of hiring a 3<sup>rd</sup> party Logistics and
    Warehousing Company to manage these services. In this way, the operations of
    these services are the responsibility of the 3<sup>rd</sup> party, lightening
    the operational workload of the NaaS operator. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">This option is
    recommended for the NaaS operator as the burden of these services will decrease
    when the deployment phase is completed and only will apply for the spare
    equipment. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Equipment Vendor Services </u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Some vendors
    offer Transportation &amp; Logistics services for their equipment, so NaaS
    operators can rely on them. However, this only applies to certain regions and
    vendors that include these services as part of its purchase agreements. If the
    vendor provides these services as an additional feature, the considerations of
    the 3rd Party Managed Services are applicable. </p>
    
    <h4><a>5.1.5.2
    Infrastructure</a></h4>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The
    Infrastructure strategy describes the model that NaaS operators will implement
    to build and manage the required network infrastructure (e.g. Fiber
    Infrastructure, Sites, and Towers). The following subsections examine different
    models to implement this strategy.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Own
    Infrastructure</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The NaaS
    operator can perform these activities with its own resources if it already has
    an existing infrastructure (e.g. MNO with existing mobile network, Tower/Fiber
    Companies) or if it possesses enough resources (e.g funding and personnel) to
    deploy them.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The development
    of this option requires an additional design phase for the new infrastructure to
    be deployed and additional time to acquire the sites. Moreover, it may
    represent high additional costs such as material (e.g. fiber optic, steel),
    machinery and equipment construction. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">More details on
    the processes related to the infrastructure design and implementation are
    included as part of the Tower/Site construction and Fiber Construction modules.
    </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Infrastructure
    Sharing</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Infrastructure
    sharing models can have a profound, positive impact on the economics of network
    deployment into rural and remote areas. In this model, the involved partners
    share the capital and investment costs of the network infrastructure
    deployment. For NaaS operators, potential partners to be considered by the NaaS
    operator are MNOs with no coverage in the area, Tower or Fiber companies. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">When the
    infrastructure is already deployed, the operation and maintenance tasks can be
    shared or can be absorbed by one of the parties as part of the initial
    agreements. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Leased
    Infrastructure</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">If there is
    infrastructure available in the area, the NaaS operator can lease the
    infrastructure to a 3<sup>rd</sup> party (e.g. MNO with 2G/3G coverage,
    Tower/Fiber Companies). In this form, the NaaS operator can avoid investment in
    new infrastructure deployment. The most common type of leased infra is in the
    form of telecom towers and transport networks. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Additionally,
    the operation and maintenance of the infrastructure are absorbed by the 3<sup>rd</sup>
    party, lightening the operational workload of the NaaS operator. </p>
    
    <h3 style='margin-left:35.45pt'><a>5.1.6
    Operations Strategy</a></h3>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The operations
    strategy defines the model that NaaS operators will follow to perform the
    network operation and maintenance tasks. This includes the management of the
    Network Operation Center (NOC), Field Maintenance and Service Operations Center
    (SOC), as required. Figure 11 displays the different alternatives related to
    the Operations Strategy. The NaaS operator must evaluate each alternative and
    select the most appropriate according to its conditions. The final decision
    must be recorded in the <a>$$link_widget$$Strategy
    &amp; Scope Definition Template</a>.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><img border=0
    width=390 height=132 id=image6.png
    src="20200608%20Module%20Content%20Strategy%20&amp;%20Scope%20v2_archivos/image011.png"></p>
    
    <p align=center><i>Figure 11. Operations Strategy
    Alternatives</i></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Self-Managed
    Services</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The NaaS
    operator can perform the network operation and maintenance activities with its
    own resources and facilities. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">However, it
    represents additional costs for the required specialized staff to perform the
    activities. Furthermore, it may represent additional costs such as rent of
    space and specialized Network Systems.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text"><b><u>3<sup>rd</sup>
    Party Managed Services</u></b></p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">An alternative
    option is to hire a 3<sup>rd</sup> party Company that manages the network
    operation and maintenance activities. In this way, these activities are the
    responsibility of the 3<sup>rd</sup> party, lightening the operational workload
    of the NaaS operator. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">This model is
    also convenient when sites are deployed in rural locations that are far away
    the locations the NaaS operates from. Therefore, the disposal of local
    resources is also a deciding factor to select a 3<sup>rd</sup> party company. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In this
    scenario, the cost of specialized hardware cannot be avoided because most of
    the network equipment requires a Licensed Software to perform the network
    operation and maintenance activities.</p>
    
    <h3 style='margin-left:35.45pt'><a>5.1.7
    Organization Design</a></h3>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The organization
    design specifies the division of functional areas within the NaaS operator
    structure. It establishes the different levels of hierarchy within the
    organization and delimits the responsibilities of each of them.</p>
    
    <p align=center>Figure 12
    presents a typical NaaS operator organizational structure. This structure
    includes a Leadership Team which develops the Strategy &amp; Scope and the
    High-level Project Plan. </p>

    <p align=center><i>Figure 12. Typical NaaS operator
    Organizational Structure.</i></p>
    
    <p align=center>Figure 12
    displays five areas that are required for the successful operations of the NaaS
    operator:</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Engineering:</u></i> Responsible for the generation of the HLD/LLD
    Network Designs for the different network segments and technologies. It also
    performs the technical evaluation of different vendor equipment solutions.ï¿½ </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Deployment:</u></i> Manages the activities relevant to the network
    deployment including among others the installation &amp; commissioning and
    integration of the network equipment. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Operations &amp;
    Maintenance:</u></i> Oversees the
    activities related to network operation and maintenance, including among others
    the monitoring of the network and the incidence response. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Commercial / Business
    Development:</u></i> Supports with
    commercial related activities such as the procurement process and vendor
    management. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Financial &amp; Legal:
    </u></i>Controls financial
    resources of the NaaS operator as well as provides the legal support required. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Depending on the
    size of the NaaS operator, the management and supervision of the available
    resources can be done by one person for all the areas. However, in larger
    organizations, a manager for each function might be required. The specific
    resource requirements for each of the presented areas are examined in more
    detail in the High Level Project Plan Module.</p>

    Long-Term Strategic Objectives Definition</a></a></h2>
    
    <p class="normal-text">A long-term strategic objective is a long-term (e.g. 3-5 years),
    broad, continuous statements that holistically address the different areas of
    the NaaS operator.ï¿½ Long-term objectives that are viable and appropriate should
    remain as something that will not change and must be achieved.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The long-term strategic objectives should consider the SWOT
    analysis. In this way, they will be built on the strengths of the company, fix
    weaknesses, pursue opportunities and resolve any threats.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In order to define the long-term strategic objectives, the key
    activities that need to be performed to achieve the vision must be identified
    considering the strategies presented in section 5.1.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">An example of a long-term strategic objective in the NaaS operator
    context is: </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    To expand network coverage
    for 10,000 people in the rural La Selva Lacandona area in the following 3
    years.</p>
    
    <br><h2 class="titulo-h2"><a>5.3
    Set Organization-Wide Goals and Measures</a></a></h2>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Once the long-term objectives have been identified, they must be
    translated into goals and measures that can be clearly communicated to the
    leadership team. Effective goals clearly state what, when, how, and who, and
    they are specifically measurable. They should address the tasks that need to be
    performed in the short-term (1-3 years) to achieve the strategic objectives. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The organization-wide goals should present the following
    characteristics: </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Specific</u></i>: Goals need to be specific as they answer the
    questions of ï¿½How much?ï¿½ and ï¿½What kindï¿½.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Measurable</u></i>: Goals must be stated in quantifiable terms.
    Measurable goals facilitate management planning, implementation, and control.
    For example, a measure might be ï¿½# of new customersï¿½ or ï¿½% completeï¿½.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Attainable</u></i>: Goals need to be achievable. The goals must be
    realistically reached by the NaaS operator </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Responsible person</u></i>: Goals must be assigned to a person or a
    department. The goal responsible needs to be the point person who will ensure
    the goal is achieved.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Time-specific</u></i>: With reference to time, goals must include a
    timeline of when they should be accomplished. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Examples of long-term strategic objectives in the NaaS operator
    context that comply with the SMART characteristics are: </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    Design team must deliver the
    RAN and Transport Designs for 20 sites in the following year. </p>

    <p class="normal-text">This section
    includes methodologies to control and manage the implementation of the defined

    strategies as well as measure and monitor progress towards strategic targets.</p>
    
    <br><h2 class="titulo-h2"><a>6.1
    KPI Definition</a></a></h2>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are the critical indicators of
    progress towards an intended result. KPIs provide a focus for strategic
    improvement and create an analytical basis for decision making. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">In order to generate a KPI for the strategy implementation, the
    following elements must be defined:</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Units of measure: </u></i>Identify the units of measures associated with
    each goal. If this cannot be performed, a standard measure should be picked to
    track the goal.ï¿½ </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Target: </u></i>The target is the numeric value that needs to be
    achieved. This target must be set according to the units of measure and the
    timeframe in which need to be accomplished. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Source: </u></i>Clearly identify where the source of the
    reporting measure and who is responsible for reporting on it.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    <i><u>Frequency</u></i>: Is the frequency of the reporting measurement
    for the KPI. The recommended frequency is to review the strategy performance on a monthly basis.ï¿½ </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">A useful form to present the KPIs is through the use of the Strategy
    Scorecard as displayed in Table 4. The NaaS operator should construct a similar
    Strategy Scorecard with the specific objectives KPIs for each of the Strategies
    presented in Section 5.1.</p>

    drive future results and hold people accountable for making sure those
    activities happen. Furthermore, the adopted strategies can change based on
    competitors and government actions, therefore, strategy meetings are important
    as the world around the NaaS evolves. </p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">A Schedule for Progress Reviews must be defined, describing the
    specific dates and communication channels to communicate with stakeholders
    regarding the strategic plan and the associated progress. This schedule should
    be employed by strategy managers in the organization to ensure the awareness
    about the intent and progress of the strategic plan is fully understood by key
    stakeholders.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">The following steps must be perform to define the Schedule for
    Progress Reviews:</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">ï¿½
    Set up monthly strategy
    meetings. Monthly strategy meetings donï¿½t need to take a lot of time but it is
    important that key team members report on their progress toward the goals they
    are responsible for, including reporting on metrics in the scorecard they have
    been assigned.</p>
    
    <p class="normal-text">Furthermore, a frequency
    greater than quarterly to review the strategy performance must be avoided. </p>

                        composed by one or more base stations (BTS) distributed over the coverage
                        region. Basic components of a Radio Base station are: Antenna, Radio Frequency
                        (RF) unit (commonly known as Radio Remote Unit or RRU) and the Baseband unit
                        (BBU). These components can be arranged in a couple of ways (configurations)
                        depending on the location of the BBU versus the RRUs and antennas. These
                        configurations are classified into Distributed RAN and Centralized RAN.</p>

                        RRUs is known as fronthaul. Each BTS has direct communication to the Core
                        Network via the Transport Network. Figure 4 displays the distribution for a

                        <p class="normal-text">Advances in
                        radio design have led to the incorporation of the BBU and an RRU in a single
                        box (all-in-one equipment) located closer to the antenna on the tower or pole.
                        This means savings in both space and energy consumption, reducing CAPEX
                        compared to the traditional BBU+RRU approach. This all-in-one (AiO) approach is
                        a solution commonly used for small cell sites.</p>

                        and synchronization requirements. Usually, these requirements make necessary
                        the deployment of fiber optic to connect the remote site with the centralized
                        BBUs; in addition, distance between the centralized and the remote sites is
                        constrained as well (Maximum distance between 10 and 40km). Further detail

                        is often referred to as the central BBU and is seen as a pool of radio
                        resources for the remote RRUs. C-RAN also allows functionalities that improve
                        network performance by coordinating cells from different BTS. The Coordinated
                        multipoint (CoMP) functionality is a transmission method in which the reception
                        from different cells is tightly coordinated. This results in higher system
                        capacity and improved data rates.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The
                        centralization of a BBU simplifies radio resource management in areas with high
                        concentrations of network users (such as populated towns, transportation
                        stations, large events, etc.) that can put high stress on the base station that
                        serves the area. In these scenarios, the action of adding more D-RAN type sites
                        can increase cost and can lead to signal interference if the base stations are
                        not carefully coordinated.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Although the
                        need of a fronthaul transport network might appear to increase the total cost
                        of ownership (TCO) of the RAN, it has been proved that that a centralized RAN
                        reduces both the CAPEX and the OPEX compared with a traditional RAN.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">In addition,
                        some network suppliers offer the possibility of deploying virtualized versions
                        of the physical BBU equipment as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) to be
                        deployed on a data center together with VNFs corresponding to different network
                        components such as core network components. Virtualization is a technology that
                        is gaining strong interest and popularity in 5G standards and networks. In
                        fact, 5G is a Cloud-native solution that considers must of is components to
                        operate in cloud environments, introducing flexibility to use the same
                        equipment (like data centers) to host multiple virtual elements instead of
                        current function specific equipment.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Deeper insight
                        into the differences between D-RAN and C-RAN and how the integration of cloud
                        RAN is performed will be given in the <a class="a_link" href="https://github.com/teleworxllc/NaaSRunBook/tree/gh-pages/High%20Level%20Network%20Architecture/Primers/Cloud_RAN_Basics.pdf">Primer on Cloud

                        <h3><a></a>D-RAN vs C-RAN Cost Efficiency</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">C-RAN pools BBU
                        resources, eliminating the cooling and space requirements at the cell site
                        reducing both CAPEX and OPEX due to smaller footprint, lower electricity
                        consumption and fewer maintenance visits.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">However, as
                        mentioned before, the use of a C-RAN architecture requires the introduction of
                        a fiber network for the fronthaul transport network. In rural environments,
                        this often represents an investment that is bigger than the savings introduced
                        by the baseband pooling functionality and CAPEX/OPEX savings. In addition, in
                        order to centralized BBUs, the distance between each cell site and the
                        centralized BBU shall not be higher than 40 km.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Thus, in most
                        rural scenarios D-RAN is the best option due to cost trade-offs and distance
                        limitation. C-RAN could be selected in specific urban-like scenarios where the
                        traffic demand is high and concentrated in small areas, ideally where fiber is
                        already available. </p>

                            <b>Macro Cell Site</b>  Macro Cell refers to a BTS capable of
                            providing coverage for a large area (~5-10 km, depending on terrain conditions
                            and selected frequency). This wide coverage is achieved due to high transmitter
                            power (up to 40W per antenna port, depending on the equipment supplier) and
                            high towers (up to 40 m and higher) and which are Macro Cell Site
                            differentiators. They also require large infrastructure investment regarding
                            installation (tower) and power supply. This makes Macro Cell Sites to be a high
                            CAPEX option.</li>
                        
                            <li>
                            <b>Small Cell Site</b>  Small Cells are low powered (usually up to
                            10W) BTS that does not require large infrastructure (usually installed on lamp
                            poles or small towers (up to 10m)) for their operation. These characteristics
                            make Small Cells achieve a smaller coverage range (~2-5km) compared to a macro
                            cell range. In consequence, small cells are ideal to be placed in hotspots
                            traffic areas to enhance networks capacity or to fill coverage holes left by
                            Macro Cell Sites. However, in rural environments, small cells are usually
                            deployed in regions where the deployment of a Macro Cell site is not
                            cost-effective due to geodemographic and traffic characteristics of the region.</li>

                        spectrum is a limited resource that is managed by a regulatory body in each
                        country. For this reason, the selection of an appropriate spectrum band and carrier
                        bandwidth depends on factors such as the country's regulatory policies,
                        spectrum fees, available spectrum chunks, MNO partners spectrum position and
                        unlicensed spectrum conditions.</p>

                        Overlay scenarios it is necessary to set guard bands between LTE and existing
                        2G and 3G technologies in order to avoid interference between the co-located
                        systems and a degradation in the service.</p>

                        can select its operating band based on one of the following considerations:</p>

                            <li class="normal-text">Re-farming (OVERLAY
                            SCENARIO): LTE system can operate over existing 2G  GSM and 3G  UMTS bands
                            (e.g. Band 3: 1800MHz or Band 8: 900MHz) in overlay scenarios. As a result,
                            operators can re-farm parts of the spectrum currently used for 2G or 3G voice
                            and data services to support LTE. Spectrum re-farming is a cost-effective way
                            to increase capacity in existing networks without the need to bid for new
                            spectrum and by reutilizing infrastructure to overlay LTE. However, the only
                            way re-farming is feasible is when the NaaS Operator or its partners/customers
                            have enough contiguous spectrum (this means that the operating frequency band
                            has enough spectrum left to insert a new carrier) to allow simultaneous
                            operation of two or three technologies in a frequency band.</li>
                            <li class="normal-text">Leverage from partners
                            spectrum: NaaS Operator can use the spectrum previously assigned to its partner
                            (in case partner has already been assigned a 4G band).</li>
                            <li class="normal-text">Use an Unlicensed band:
                            Electromagnetic spectrum is a scarce resource that is regulated and assigned by
                            each country governmental institutions. However, the utilization of unlicensed
                            spectrum in the 5GHz range has been gaining interest in past years because it allows an operator to deploy LTE
                            services without the necessity of bidding for a licensed spectrum. On the other
                            hand, the use of unlicensed spectrum imposes transmission power limitations,
                            which limits coverage area of the BTS. In addition, NaaS Operator needs to
                            verify if other operations are using unlicensed spectrum in the area, as this may
                            cause a considerable amount of interference. NaaS Operator can find additional
                            information about unlicensed bands for LTE in
                            the <a class="a_link" href="https://github.com/teleworxllc/NaaSRunBook/tree/gh-pages/High%20Level%20Network%20Architecture/Primers/LTE_Unlicensed_Spectrum.pdf">Primer for LTE in Unlicensed Spectrum</a>. 
                            NaaS Operator must be aware that the operation
                            of LTE in unlicensed spectrum may not be supported by all user devices.</li>
                            <li class="normal-text">Get Spectrum from government: NaaS Operator can
                            bid to be assigned an LTE band following country regulations. Moreover, some
                            countries around the world have been interested in facilitating unused spectrum
                            to service providers that are willing to bring mobile services to uncovered
                            populations (see <a class="a_link" href="https://www.rhizomatica.org/">Rhizomatica</a> initiative). NaaS Operator can see if this same principle
                            applies in its own environment.</li>

                        point of view, low frequencies (&lt; 1GHz) provide extended network coverage at
                        lower cost as fewer base stations are required to achieve greater geographic
                        coverage. On the other hand, Higher frequencies (&gt;1 GHz) are primarily used
                        to cover urban and suburban areas where data traffic is dense and substantial
                        network capacity is required (higher spectrum bands normally provide larger
                        bandwidths which allow for larger transmission rates). Figure 8 shows spectrum

                        and a bandwidth that covers its present and future necessities in terms of

                        coverage and capacity performance. A 5MHz bandwidth can be useful to bring
                        connectivity to an uncovered population but will be limited in terms of
                        capacity performance. Having large bandwidths (e.g. higher than 20MHz)
                        introduces the possibility for a capacity expansion using a second carrier.</p>

                        like 2G-GSM or 3G-UMTS is the guard band requirement. More specifically, when
                        LTE is co-located with other technologies in the same site where nearby
                        antennas or sharing scenarios are adopted then a guard band needs to be

                            the orthogonal nature of LTE access scheme. For this reason, there is no need

                        Duplexing (TDD). FDD scheme uses one frequency for downlink (DL) and another
                        frequency for uplink (UL); allowing simultaneous communication between BTS and
                        UE. On the other hand, in TDD scheme both BTS and UE use the same frequency for
                        their transmissions, preventing simultaneous communication and implementing a
                        dedicated time slot for transmission (TX) and for reception (RX). Figure 10

                        <p style="font-size: 16px;">For the case of small cells, most equipment in
                        the market can achieve 10W (40 dBm) as maximum transmission power. In MORAN
                        scenarios (as will be discussed in section 3.3.1) a 10W small cell can allow
                        the implementation of two independent 5W carriers (one per Mobile Operator).
                        This rule should be always considered for small cell definition because
                        increasing the power with small transmitter heights has diminishing returns.</p>
                        
                        <p style="font-size: 16px;"><a></a>For transmit power ranges above 10W,
                        network design should consider a macro cell site for the design process.
                        Maximum power can be set according to the following point.</p>
                        
                        <li>
                        Tower height: As will be
                        detailed in the RAN HLD module, the higher the transmitter is from the ground,
                        the wider the coverage area achieved by the BTS (tower height consideration
                        does not have an important impact in small cells as these are usually located
                        in smaller infrastructure). In this sense, NaaS Operator can use this principle
                        to set higher transmitter power to those sites that will be placed on high towers in order to reach a
                        wider coverage area. Table 7 shows an example of how to define maximum allowed
                        transmitter power for macro cell sites according to transmitters height.</li>

                        must be able to accommodate new infrastructure (BBU, RRUs or antennas) to be
                        considered as Overlay ones. This means that they must contain enough space on
                        the towers and power sources to install and feed the new equipment. A site
                        survey should be held in order to evaluate if existing sites are candidates for
                        an overlay deployment. The RAN HLD Module provides a questionnaire for the
                        evaluation of existing sites in order to define whether they can be used for an
                        overlay or not. This evaluation must be held by a site survey to the desired site.
                        Details for the site survey will be given in the <a class="a_link" href="">Site Survey Module.</a></p>

                        <p class="normal-text">NaaS Operator
                        central strategy is to enable business to MNOs in new areas without them having
                        to invest on network infrastructure. Instead, MNOs can provide their network
                        services using NaaS Operators infrastructure and network resources.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">NaaS Operator
                        can provide its RAN infrastructure to multiple MNOs based on the following
                        sharing schemes: </p>
                        
                        <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
                            <li>Multi-Operator RAN (MORAN):
                            This scheme allows to share BBUs between MNOs but not radio carriers (RRUs are
                            not shared). This implies that every MNO will serve its subscribers in its own
                            spectrum chunk.</li>
                            <li>Multi-Operator Core Network
                            (MOCN): This scheme allows all elements in the RAN (BBUs and RRUs) to be
                            shared. The difference is that MOCN allows radio carriers to be shared too
                            which makes MOCN to be the most resource efficient. Moreover, MOCN can be
                            deployed quickly as it only requires the feature to be configured in the RAN.
                            This makes MOCN ideal as a solution for quick coverage expansion. By activating
                            MOCN on an existing network, subscribers from a new MNO customer can get access
                            to the NaaS Operator network. Mobile cores of the various MNOs using the NaaS Operator network are
                            independent.</li>
                            <li>Roaming Agreements between
                            NaaS Operator and MNO: In this scheme no RAN resources are shared. Instead,
                            NaaS Operator owns the RAN and the core network and redirects traffic to MNOs
                            core networks. In this case, the user might have to enable roaming on their
                            phone to access the NaaS network.</li>

                        <h3>3.3.2 VoLTE Implementation Evaluation</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Voice over LTE
                        (VoLTE) is the 4G-LTE solution to provide voice services in an LTE network.
                        VoLTE provides high-quality voice and video services. However, this section
                        only applies if at strategy level the NaaS Operator has decided to provide
                        voice services.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The
                        implementation of VoLTE on a network brings the following requirements:</p>
                        
                        <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
                            <li>Integration of an IP
                            Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) on the core structure as standard EPC is not able to support VoLTE on its own.
                            Possible strategy is to reach an agreement with MNO(s) in order to redirect
                            traffic from NaaS Operators core network to MNOs IMS or from NaaS Operators
                            RAN to MNOs core network (which includes an IMS).</li>
                            <li>Additional RAN
                            functionalities (that will be detailed in section 3.3.3) that are basic for the
                            operation of VoLTE in the air interface.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">These
                        requirements represent an addition to the networks CAPEX, increasing NaaS
                        Operator investment. Additionally, the configuration of VoLTE on a BTS means
                        extra integration efforts.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">However, NaaS
                        Operator can avoid the implementation of VoLTE if LTE BTSs are deployed as an
                        overlay in locations where existing 2G and/or 3G sites are already operating.
                        Voice in overlay scenarios can be carried by the existing RATs using the
                        Circuit Switched FallBack (CSFB) functionality which allows an user equipment
                        (UE) connected to the LTE system to move to 2G-GSM or 3G-UMTS in order to
                        complete the voice communication. Once the voice call is over, the UE returns
                        to LTE. CSFB principle is shown in Figure 17.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">For these
                        reasons, the implementation of the CSFB functionality is preferable from
                        financial and sites configuration points of view. However, CSFB principle does
                        not apply in cases where there are no existing sites operating with 2G and/or
                        3G. In other words, VoLTE is the only option to provide voice services on
                        Greenfield Scenarios.</p>
