                        available suppliers and their effect on the environment. The NaaS operator

                            Furthermore, it is fundamental that the examined vendors offer Proven
                            Technology and provide evidence of their equipment in production. Some of the
                            providers will require international transportation to the NaaS operator

                        <p class="normal-text">An analysis regarding the terrain conditions must be conducted,
                        especially in rural areas. The specific geographic features (e.g. mountains,
                        dense forest) may significantly complicate the network deployment for remote
                        populations as the access to the site for construction and maintenance may
                        complicate. Furthermore, harsh climates (e.g. extreme hot or cold) can make the
                        operation and maintenance tasks of the site more challenging. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This analysis has a direct impact on the subsequent design and
                        deployment phases as often extensive microwave or fiber optic laying must be
                        required in the transport network. If the terrestrial solutions are not
                        feasible, NaaS operators often have to rely on satellite transport with
                        additional expensive bandwidth fees to connect remote areas. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">In addition to the terrain, the climate can also have a significant
                        impact on the satellite signals as these are vulnerable to rain conditions that
                        can occur regularly in tropical areas. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">In further deployment phases, it is important to perform a Technical
                        Site Survey (TSS) on each site to clearly define the geographic conditions. </p>

                        <p class="normal-text">The network deployment in rural and remote locations is directly
                        impacted by a lack of basic infrastructure (e.g. power grid, road access). If
                        adverse conditions are presented, the Naas operator must build each site in a
                        self-sufficient manner (e.g. solar energy-based). This represents an increment
                        in the deployment costs and subsequent operations and maintenance costs. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Furthermore, the quality of the basic infrastructure must be
                        identified as bad quality infrastructure may represents additional costs on the
                        site operations (e.g. bad quality power grid may require backup batteries). </p>

                        approached in different ways as their needs and values are different. Rather
                        than trying to compete in the entire market, the NaaS operator must identify
                        parts of the market that can be served best and most profitably.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The most effective way to achieve this is to segment customers. The
                        goal of creating customer segments is so that specific customers that have
                        similar needs can be targeted with the same products and pricing. </p>

                            However, these types of
                            providers do not have great penetration in

                        that offer important avenues for profitable growth, those where a company has
                        the most potential for competitive development, and those that match up well
                        with the financial and organizational resource capabilities that the company
                        already possesses or can acquire.</p>

                        in which the NaaS operator performs successfully. An analysis of organization
                        strengths should be market and customer-focused because strengths are only
                        meaningful when they assist in meeting customer needs. Strengths give the

                        condition that puts it at a disadvantage. Weaknesses should also be examined
