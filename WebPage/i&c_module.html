                        Radio Units and Antennas. Figure 8 shows the most common scenario in rural
                        deployments: The baseband, rectifiers, and batteries are installed within IP55
                        outdoor cabinets at the base of a tower or a monopole, antennas, and radios at
                        the top of it. Optic fibers are connected between baseband and radios going
                        down along the tower secured with fiber clips in the tower body. In a similar
                        way, power cables go down from radios to power equipment; antennas and radios
                        are interconnected using RF cables.</p>

                    to carry out (out-sourcing). In-sourcing implies that NaaS Operators have the
                    required job profiles within their organization or that they can hire
                    additional workforce. On the other hand, choosing to out-source I&amp;C
                    activities require an extra investment. Therefore, sourcing selection implies a
                    tradeoff between spending financial resources on a third party, building an
                    internal team with the resources that NaaS Operators already have or hiring
                    additional collaborators.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3.1.1
                    Insourcing Scheme</h3>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">In case of the insourcing having an internal employee will
                    allow NaaS Operators to customize the process if its required since insourcing
                    staff will respond to changes more quickly than if they are under outsourcing
                    scheme. Additionally, after the I&amp;C process, the NaaS employees can move to
                    other tasks such as Network Maintenance where they will need less management
                    and likely have fewer mistakes than an employee under an outsourcing scheme that
                    feels no loyalty to the NaaS Operators business.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Please note that in case of insourcing the cost of required
                    tools, vehicles and Personal Protective Equipment is absorbed by NaaS
                    Organization, it is a best practice plan to take care of these tools to be used
                    in forthcoming phases.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3.1.2
                    Outsourcing Vendor Scheme</h3>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">In the case of Outsourcing the
                    most common option is to hire professional services from vendors or consultants
                    for the I&amp;C tasks. Vendors organize their own team, including
                    Implementation Managers, Project Managers, Specialized Integration Engineers
                    for RAN, Core, among others. The offered services will vary depending on the
                    agreement and very likely will increase the cost but will facilitate the whole
                    deployment.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text"><a></a>If NaaS Operators choose to Out-Source
                    personnel, payroll, additional benefits and social security taxes will depend
                    on outside contractors responsibility. Depending on the agreement, additional
                    costs such as Tools, Vehicles and Personal Protective Equipment can be included
                    in the contractors agreements. </p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Additionally, Out-Sourcing contractors provide a great deal
                    of flexibility to the NaaS organization and their service can be used at the
                    convenience of the NaaS Operator. This is especially helpful in situations
                    where the implementation is altered in some way. If, for example, the roll-out
                    is halted in a region due to any reason that doesnt depend on NaaS Operators
                    plans, therefore, when using the services of outside contractors, there is no
                    need to stop the work and maintain idle resources.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Below is a list of considerations for NaaS Operators

                    Changes will be initiated where existing safety procedures are found to be
                    inadequate or in need of improvement. As a best
                    practice, NaaS Operators may include a list and key actions for their field
                    workers to perform the Safe Work Procedures in their Methods of Procedures for
                    installation tasks, register that they comply with a checklist or a signed

                    Security Procedures Definition</h3>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">NaaS Operator and site owners may use a Security control
                    with an Access Procedure, which consists of controlling visitors to the site.
                    Visitors must obtain written authorization from the Site Owner before entering
                    into the Site. This should be submitted to the Site Owner with the Access
                    Request Form. Field workers must carry relevant records of their competency and
                    a copy of the Safe Work Procedures on each visit to the Site.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Field Technicians that are accessing a Site for any reason
                    may perform potentially hazardous tasks or have the potential to interrupt a
                    Service of another company; the Site Owner must need to know what activities
                    are being undertaken on the Site. The more information that visitors can
                    provide, the better. As a Best Practice, Access to Sites can only be given for
                    the permitted use described in an approved Access Request Form. Any additional
                    work or variations to the initial proposal must be submitted to the Site Owner
                    or Infrastructure Owner for further approval. An <a class="a_link" href="https://github.com/teleworxllc/NaaSRunBook/blob/gh-pages/Deployment/Templates/MOE%20I%26C-Site-Access-Form-Template%20DRAFT.docx"></a>Access Request

                    <h3>4.1.3
                    Security Requirements</h3>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">NaaS Operator may consider adding working periods in their Access Request Form, this is made
                    to avoid working overlap during that period. This will avoid unauthorized
                    visitors and enhance the control of any Security Issue. Over-estimations of
                    access times may be refused, especially where such access inconveniences other Service
                    users. Under-estimations of access times must also be avoided, as
                    under-estimations also often lead to Service interruptions due to work running
                    overtime.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Additionally, to control the
                    access to the NaaS Operator Network during Commissioning and Integration
                    process all stakeholders must previously request access to the network to the
                    Network Operation Center (NOC) with their users ID to perform the network
                    configurations, as was mentioned previously In the NaaS Operator
                    Scenario, the Core Network may belong to a Mobile Network Operator (MNO). If
                    this is the case, the NaaS Operator Integration team and MNO personnel schedule
                    the integration of the RAN site to the MNO Core Network. This is commonly
                    performed by MNO staff. </p>

                    Pre-Work Guidelines</h3>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Before Installation Procedures, a set of tasks must be
                    prepared to enable seamless work, avoiding delays and rework which result in
                    cost overruns. The scope of the Pre-work task is to ensure to have all requirements
                    (e.g. BoQs, Site Survey Reports, TX LLD, RAN LLD, Vendor Installation &amp;
                    Configuration Guides) to prepare the following tasks:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
                        <li>Request Access Permits.</li>
                        <li>Control and Manage the outgoing Equipment from the warehouse.</li>
                        <li>Plan the transportation routes from the warehouse to the sites.</li>
                        <li>Customize the MOP by site basis.</li>
                        <li>Generate the configuration files for each site.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">In this way, all requirements will be ready before Field
                    Technicians arrive at the remote sites. A Best Practice is to identify the
                    points of contact (PoC) for each requirement; they will upload their respective
                    documents to cloud platforms such as Google Drive, DropBox, or SharePoint. In
                    this way, the information can be easily referenced.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">In addition, the NaaS Operator must identify the points of
                    contact (PoC) or site owners for each site to coordinate access and activities.
                    All these pre-requirements may be used as a go-no go enabler to start with
                    the equipment transportation tasks. </p>

                    by the NaaS Operator or the site is leased to MNOs tower or a private building.
                    The site owner must be properly identified for each site to perform the Site
                    Access Procedures. A best practice is performing the procedure several days in
                    advance,(Quantity of days will depend on each Site owner) this must be done for
                    each work visit in every site. </p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">The Deployment Manager may carry out this activity, sending
                    the Access Request Form to the Site Owner previously identified filled with the
                    required information of all Field Technicians and ensure that they are properly

                    <p class="normal-text">The checklist must be shared and signed by all stakeholders.
                    As a best practice, it must be included in the close-out package as proof that

                    of the NaaS Operators vehicles, saving time and cutting expenses). Improving
                    the planning process to reduce the number of trucks, miles and drivers can
                    increase the efficiency of the business.</p>

                        team that is transporting the equipment will perform the installation,
                        additional stops are just to drop the Network Equipment in the sites where
                        other teams will receive the equipment.</li>

                        the vehicle load capacity and comply with road regulations avoiding possible
                        fines and delays.</li>
                    
                        <li>
                        <b>Obtain the load capacity of the
                        Vehicles</b>: The load capacity will define
                        the available stops, a small vehicle should definitely go directly to the destination
                        site, however, a high load truck can stop at several sites.</li>

                    kits, filling the Site Equipment Reception Checklist verifying that all
                    equipment arrived in optimal conditions. This task must also be performed if a

                    <p class="normal-text">Labeling is an important task of any installation procedure;
                    it enables an easy management of the cabling by identifying each cable that is connected
                    to all network equipment. Labeling is very important during the maintenance
                    phase when a team who didnt construct the site needs to troubleshoot the
                    equipment.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">NaaS Operators must define the Cabling Standards for all
                    connections, including labeling for the following cables:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>

                    <p class="normal-text">As a Best practice the labels must be in both extreme of the
                    cables and establish a code for each type of cable as for example the Jumper
                    Cables in the Antenna :</p>

                    Marks and One Yellow mark. The meaning will depend on NaaS Operators Standards.
                    Labeling should be added in the Method of Procedure and a best practice is to
                    add a table with the labeling requirements/standard.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4.1.4
                    Commissioning and Integration Guidelines</h3>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Transmission Commissioning refers to the process that
                    creates the links to the Core Network and to the Management system, which is
                    considered as a pre-requisite of RAN commissioning which depends on the Core
                    functions. The Transmission Commissioning process depends on the transmission
                    scenario since the process is different between commissioning a Site Cell
                    router, a Microwave System, or a Satellite Modem. </p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Vendors of each scenario must provide detailed documentation
                    to commission their equipment; NaaS Operators must read and understand this
                    documentation in order to process it and address it to their Field Personnel. </p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">RAN vendors use different methods and instructions for
                    commissioning their equipment; for example, there are vendors with features
                    that allow an Automatic Discovery of the Base Station in their O&amp;M system
                    under certain conditions without manual intervention. NaaS Operators can
                    evaluate if this feature is applicable in their network and is under their
                    budget. </p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">This section analyzes some processes that NaaS operators can
                    consider to facilitate Commissioning and Integration tasks that will depend on
                    the NaaS Operators staff profiles.</p>

                    power-up, the remaining portion of the integration is performed remotely from
                    O&amp;M system. Pre-configure equipment under controlled circumstances saves
                    time in the site where backhaul is less robust causing delays in the reception
                    of the configuration files, additionally, if troubleshooting is required is

                    Then after installation concludes, field technicians power-up the equipment and
                    proceed to load the commissioning script from there the process is the same as
                    described in Figure 16.</p>

                    <p class="normal-text">The processes described above are generic processes that all
                    vendors support, there are some vendors that allow an auto-configuration of
                    the Base Station under certain conditions such as Self Organized Network (SON)
                    that greatly reduce manual intervention. After NaaS operators develop their processes,
                    they can elaborate their own guidelines.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">The scope of forthcoming subsections is to guide the NaaS
                    Operators to prepare their own Commissioning and Integration guidelines

                    Process, which is performed manually in the warehouse (or site) by the Field
                    Engineer and supported remotely by an Integration Engineer, which is the

                    Station Elements, reviewing the Alarm Status, commonly will show several alarms
                    such as there is no license for the Base Station, there is no contact to the
                    Core Network Elements or theres hardware that has not been configured such as
                    Radio Units or RET among other alarms. Integration Engineer must clear these

                    must be configured in the Base Station, the architecture of a Base Station will
                    depend on Vendor selection, commonly the Base Station also includes RF Cards to
                    connect the Radio Units and Transport Cards to connect the Transmission
                    equipment by fiber or ethernet cables.</p>

                    features that a NaaS operator is allowed to use in the Base Station. The
                    license is normally controlled and managed with a serial number. After the
                    license has been successfully installed, the next step is to Configure the Base
                    Station related parameters as previously defined in RAN LLD, such as

                    scenario, the Core network elements may not belong to NaaS Operator Network.
                    Depending on the Agreement NaaS Operator Integration Engineer can configure the

                    undergoes a series of inspections, operability, and service tests such as
                    physical site inspections cell management, functionality of alarms and end to
                    end service tests to ensure proper functionality. This process is supported by
