                        <h3><a></a>3.1.1 Network Surveillance</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Network surveillance is the first
                        and most vital function that is supported by a NOC. NOC staff performs
                        continuous monitoring of all the network elements, using available tools like a
                        network monitoring system (see Network Monitoring Architecture module) or via
                        the different element management systems (EMS) provided by equipment vendors.
                        In addition, the NaaS Operator must grant limited access to these systems to
                        the MNO NOCs to monitor only the elements of the network related to their
                        users.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">For those network or performance
                        alarms detected, NOC staff will conduct preliminary filtering (such as
                        correlation, alarms due to planned work, etc.), open the corresponding trouble
                        ticket (TT), monitor the alarm warnings, categorize/prioritize the alert
                        severity and handle the problem escalation according to defined procedures.
                        During this stage, a constant communication between the tenant NOCs and the
                        NaaS operator NOC will lead to a better categorization, filtering and avoidance
                        of unnecessary TT.</p>

                        compatibility may be an issue, a primitive method could be used such as phone

                            measured against each severity category (critical, major, medium, minor). This
                            can also be categorized per MNO, depending on the opener.</li>

                            1 team on initial fault isolation and diagnosis before escalating the ticket to
                            the corresponding fix agent. This can also be categorized per MNO, depending on
                            the TT opener.</li>

                        interconnected to minimize communication time. One implementation option is to
                        connect the fault management systems from the NaaS operator and customer MNOs
                        using open interfaces. In this case, the NaaS operator must limit the MNOs
                        access to prevent exposing the complete network metrics or KPIs due to privacy
                        issues.</p>

                        staff, it will be escalated to tier 3 support which for most NaaS operators
                        will consist of requesting direct support from equipment vendors.</p>

                        alternative is to rely on the tier 2 and/or tier 3 from them. This would
                        decrease the required budget for the NaaS operator NOC and shorten the
                        implementation time. However, an agreement must be reached first with customer
                        MNOs. This tactic will be further reviewed in sections 6.4 and 6.5.</p>

                        based on the permissions that the NaaS operator will grant to the customer MNOs
                        to access their systems. In a similar vein, the NaaS operator NOC would require
                        permission to access the systems of the tenant NOCs so the level of access must
                        be conceded accordingly. These considerations should be handled by the OSS

                        the degree of privileges can vary from one MNO to another. If systems are interconnected  usually through APIs or

                        <p class="normal-text">As stated before, the tier 1 team
                        is the first point of contact when an issue in the network arises. However, the
                        configuration of functions for this team can vary based on the NaaS operator
                        requirements and constraints. The sections below, provide an overview and
                        guidance for NaaS operators to select the option that best suits their needs.</p>

                        Network Surveillance + Fault Management Scenario</h4>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The aggregation of network surveillance
                        and fault management is one of the most common scenarios at the tier 1 level.
                        Since network surveillance and fault management tier 1 go hand-by-hand, these
                        two functions are usually met by one single instance which is accommodated into
                        a NOC tier 1 level. This group of people will both perform real-time
                        monitoring of all alarms, create trouble tickets, perform first-level analysis
                        and diagnosis, and escalate the ticket to the corresponding fix agent if unable
                        to resolve.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The group will also be
                        responsible for all email and phone call communications regarding the tier 1
                        team, including exchanges for site conditions, active alarms, and network alarm
                        status.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">NaaS operators should select this
                        option if a high volume of alarms/tickets is not expected, or if they wish to
                        keep both functions tied to a single team in order for the tier 1 team to have
                        a complete picture of both alarms and trouble tickets.</p>
                        
                        <h4><a></a>3.2.1.2
                        Region Segmentation Scenario</h4>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Another common setup revolves
                        around aggregating the access management and field dispatch functions into the tier
                        1 team as well. This can prove effective when the NOC is monitoring a small
                        network (or if network monitoring is broken up into different regions, each one
                        covered by a small team of engineers).</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">In this scenario, the tier 1 team
                        will also be in charge of executing field dispatches (if necessary) and making
                        the necessary adjustments to make sure that there will be access to the site
                        for the field technicians.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">As mentioned before, this option
                        is best suited for region-based monitoring or for small networks, as the
                        increase in functions makes them aware of all details for their respective
                        sites, but in turn, the overhead associated with this setup may challenge the
                        team.</p>
                        
                        <h4><a></a>3.2.1.3
                        Domain Segmentation Scenario</h4>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Another common scenario is to
                        have the NOC tier 1 team segmented into the different network domains,
                        typically RAN, TX and CORE, especially if the alarm volume expected will be
                        high. As such, each team monitors and creates trouble tickets for the alarms
                        coming in from the different network elements in each domain.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">For instance, the RAN tier 1 team
                        monitoring a 4G network would receive alarms from the eNBs and the cell site routers,
                        working closely with site-level fix agents, like field technicians covering
                        such sites, tower companies, power companies and fiber companies. The TX tier 1
                        team would receive alarms from the IP aggregation and backbone routers, working
                        with field technicians, power companies and fiber service providers. Finally,
                        the CORE tier 1 team would receive alarms coming from the EPC network elements
                        like the MME, SGW, PGW, etc.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This setup is more complex than
                        the previous one, as all tier 1 teams must be in constant communication and
                        coordination to successfully correlate alarms to incidents within the network.
                        Some operators choose to have only two tier 1 teams: access (including all RAN
                        and aggregation nodes) and CORE. These segmented scenarios make more sense to
                        operators with medium-to-large site presence and can be combined with the
                        previous region segmentation mentioned earlier for better results in larger,
                        nation-wide networks.</p>
                        
                        <h4><a></a>3.2.1.4
                        Enhanced Tier 1 Scenario</h4>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Finally, one less common setup is
                        incorporating fault management tier 2 functions to the NOC tier 1 team in
                        addition to the previously mentioned functions. This is referred to as a tier
                        1.5 team, or enhanced tier 1 team.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This option may be taken for
                        budget constraints as there would only be one team overseeing, analyzing, and
                        processing all activities within the network, escalating complex cases directly
                        to the vendors. This setup requires engineers with a higher level of expertise
                        which must be taken into consideration. This can be an option for small
                        networks with more relaxed service level agreements, as cases escalated to
                        vendors may extend resolution times. </p>

                        <p class="normal-text">Each NOC group is usually
                        supervised by a manager who delivers guidance to the entire team and serves as
                        the point of contact (POC) for all those team requirements or escalations.
                        Depending on the setup that has been chosen, leaders for network surveillance, fault
                        management tier 1, fault management tier 2, performance management, OSS &amp; tools
                        management, access management, incident management and field dispatch may exist;
                        or a manager for the aggregated teams may be in place (e.g., NOC tier 1 manager,
                        NOC tier 2 manager). The entire team is supervised by a NOC head, who acts as
                        the ultimate responsible for the NOC operations.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Another common practice in
                        medium-to-large NOC organizations is to have a manager per domain, specifically
                        at the tier 2 level. This decision is based on the expertise that is needed for
                        such teams and to have a direct escalation path available for specific-domain scenarios
                        that may be present on the network, thus aiding for faster resolutions since the
                        leader can provide directions for the team and readjusting priorities as
                        needed.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Since regardless of the grouping
                        decisions the tier 1 team is always one of the biggest groups, team leaders are
                        regularly set as part of the structure (having at least one team leader per
                        shift). These people are trained engineers whose expertise and process
                        knowledge, supported by leadership empowerment, enables them to make controlled
                        operative decisions during their shift in absence of the teams manager.</p>

                            a network event or a customer MNO ticket. In the case of a network event, an
                            alarm goes into a network monitoring system (NMS). At this stage, the alarm
                            message is displayed in the EMS, and thus it appears on the screen of the fault

                            network change implementation, and rollout activities. Next, the FM tier 1
                            engineer would contact the person implementing the planned work to determine if
                            the alarm is related to the activities. If it is, and if the activities were
                            planned, the FM engineer will update the alarm and acknowledge it. This will
                            remove the alarm from the current view. </li>

                            work, the engineer moves on to the next process step: correlate incident. In
                            correlate incident, the engineer searches alarm criteria to correlate the
                            alarm with any similar alarms already recorded in incident tickets. If the
                            event is correlated, the engineer updates the incident ticket with the alarm or
                            event that was just correlated.</li>

                            The change manager serves as one entry
                            point for the work, who processes planned work information. The change manager
                            performs a first review of this information and shares the details after
                            completing the review.</li>

                            coordinator. The change coordinator performs the first analysis of the documentation,
                            creates change tickets, or reviews a change ticket already created within
                            another process.</li>
                        
                            <li class="normal-text">The first decision point for the change
                            coordinator is made based on whether a change is a normal change or a standard
                            change. </li>

                            <li class="normal-text">The normal change must first undergo an
                            administrative review by the change coordinator (a), and a technical review by
                            the subject matter expert (b) before it is authorized.</li>
                        
                            <li class="normal-text">When the review process is complete,
                            the change goes to the change advisory board (CAB) or the emergency change advisory
                            board (E-CAB). These boards may consist of a group of people, or a single
                            person.<br>
                            The CAB/E-CAB should be in constant communication with
                            their customer MNOs that can be affected by the change. An additional
                            coordination with the affected MNO may be required if the change will impact on
                            the service provided by the NaaS operator.<br>
                            Reciprocally, the tenant NOCs must notify of changes in
                            their networks that could lead to outages or any impact on the NaaS operator network
                            or services. For changes with major impact a formal notification and
                            coordination with the NaaS operator may be necessary as well.<br>
                            In parallel with the involved tenant NOC, the CAB/E-CAB
                            performs their review and evaluates the planning details to determine if theres
                            any conflict with other changes already approved and planned. The board renders
                            a decision to either reject the change and stop the process or approve the
                            change and pass it along to the next step: prepare change. The involved
                            tenant NOCs may request a delay in the activities if the impact overlaps with
                            their own activities.</li>
                        
                            <li class="normal-text">In prepare change, both the change coordinator
                            and the change implementer of NaaS NOC and tenant NOCs take care of the last
                            preparations and adjust the timing between a normal change and a standard
                            change. The next decision point is based on whether the change is a simple change
                            or a complex change. </li>
                                                    
                            <li class="normal-text">The simple change goes directly into
                            the implementation and testing phase (a). The complex change requires
                            coordination of NaaS and MNO NOCs (b), which is the responsibility of the change
                            coordinator. As the change coordinator is working, the change implementer is
                            operating in parallel to perform implementation and testing activities.</li>
                        
                            <li class="normal-text">Throughout the implementation process,
                            the change implementer needs to be in contact with the network monitoring team
                            in the NOC. The network monitoring team should be in contact with their
                            counterparts in the tenant NOCs. This contact is necessary to ask the fault management
                            tier 1 engineer if change implementation can begin.<br>
                            During the change implementation activities, there is the possibility of an unforeseen
                            issue, error, or incident that can have an impact on the planned work underway,
                            or even an outage caused by the change itself. In any of these cases, the NOC
                            is contacted for a go ahead, followed by implementation and testing.<br>
                            For example, if the change implementer loses track of time, the network monitoring
                            team should contact the change implementer when there is only a predefined
                            number of minutes left of the available maintenance window. They can discuss if
                            the change implementation can finish on time or if a rollback is necessary to
                            ensure the work remains within the requested maintenance window.<br>
                            The NOC does have the authority to recommend a rollback if there is a reason to
                            prevent any further damage or service affecting issues in the network. Also,
                            the NOC has the authority to request the
                            status of the activities on customer MNOs networks to correlate with the
                            status of its own network. If the impact if bigger than expected, the NaaS Operator
                            NOC can make a formal rollback request to the corresponding tenant NOC.</li>
                        
                            <li class="normal-text">The two possible conditions of change implementation and
                            testing are: successful or not successful with a rollback. In either case,
                            the results of the change are reviewed by the change manager, change coordinator
                            and change implementer.</li>
                            
                            <li class="normal-text">The next point is based on what kind of change took place.
                            There may have been changes to the network, or new equipment may have been
                            installed. There may have been no change except for replacing an existing card
                            with the same type of card. In this case, the next step is reporting and closing.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Once the updates in documentation to the required system
                        are performed (asset and configuration database), the process moves to the last
                        step, which is preparing the implementation report and closing the change ticket.</p>

                        <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>

                            the planned or agreed-upon committed date.</li>
                        
                            <li><b>Change causing an incident</b>  Percentage of changes that caused an incident. The
                            incident in this case is any outage or service interruption that is not
                            documented and approved by the change advisory board.</li>
                            
                            <li><b>Change volume</b>  Total number of changes approved in each month. Its
                            useful for monitoring the volume of changes implemented in a network.</li>
                            
                            <li><b>Emergency Change Rate</b>.  Percentage of changes classified as emergency against
                            the total changes implemented in the network. This is an important KPI for
                            process performance measurements. A higher count of emergency changes
                            represents a more unstable network, where incident restoration requires
                            emergency change. This can also be a result of poor change management process
                            leading to unplanned emergency changes.</li>

                            coordination and communication activities as mandatory during high impact
                            scenarios, the incident manager may be removed from the overall process. <br>
                            In this scenario, a member from the fault management tier 2 team will be in charge
                            of the incident coordination and will serve as the POC for the duration of the
                            event. The operator may decide that for escalations, awareness, and directions
                            on high-impact incidents the shift leader (if applicable), or the domain
                            manager, or even the NOC manager may be requested to attend.<br>
                            Consider that in the absence of an Incident Manager, communications during a high impact
                            scenario may not formally exist, and as such, the different teams working the
                            case must make a conscious effort to document the trouble ticket to the best of
                            their abilities, as it is often required to review all actions taken during troubleshooting
                            for improvement purposes. </li>
                        
                            <li><b>Problem Management</b><br>A
                            very common practice, at least at the early stages of NOC implementations, is
                            to leave the problem management process out from the NOC set of processes. <br>
                            Problem management is a powerful process that enables the operator to reduce the number
                            of recurring scenarios, to mitigate the impact
                            for future events or to enhance the end-customer experience by optimizing the
                            network in certain aspects. Still, operators may conclude that at early stages 
                            or in general  focus will be set on network availability alone, and that scope
                            will be limited to event detection and restoral, and not on enhancement
                            opportunities.<br> On
                            such organizations, the closest existing approach to problem management is
                            performed by the fault management tier 2 team, and usually triggered only by
                            request, generally from a high-visibility escalation. The process may be
                            executed at some extent, generally without a knowledge base properly set, and
                            as such problems detected in the network may have longer resolution times
                            compared to a fully implemented problem management organization.</li>
                        
                            <li><b>Change Management</b><br>
                            In the Change management process, the operator may judge that two different
                            entities are not relevant for the process, as the change coordinator and the change
                            manager may be comprised of a single entity
                            within the NOC structure.<br>
                            On this setup, the coordinator or the manager will inherit the activities
                            performed by the other entity within the change management process, leaving a
                            single POC for all change-related queries. <br>
                            Another option followed by some operators is to leave out
                            both the coordinator and the manager out of the equation, and as such
                            assignment of responsibilities are set internally within the change engineers
                            structure, or assigned to the NOC tier 2 team, in which case assignment per
                            domain is executed for change request review, approval and follow up.</li>

                        <p class="normal-text">There are several tools in place
                        for a NOC to achieve its objectives. The most widely used are the service desk management
                        tool, a network fault management system, a geographic information system, network
                        performance management system and network configuration management systems.
                        These will be reviewed in the following sections.</p>
                        
                        <h3><a></a>5.1.1
                        Service Desk Management Tool</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This tool is used for the
                        documentation of all incidents, problems and changes that are being worked on
                        the network at any given time. It can be considered one of the main tools used
                        by the NOC, as it enables all the team to have a proper mechanism to document
                        all activities surrounding each incident, problem or change ticket.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">A proper tool for documentation
                        aids the team as they can know exactly what the status of any ticket is, what
                        are the next items to be solved and what needs to be followed-up. It also
                        enables reporting, which serves as the basis for governance activities:
                        revision of the NOC performance, KPIs, and SLAs.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">A full service desk management
                        (SDM) tool is an immensely powerful tool that incorporates modules for incident
                        management (incident tickets), problem management (problem tickets) and change management
                        (change tickets). It also includes a Knowledge Base module (KB Articles) that
                        serves as a repository for all the KB information used by all NOC teams,
                        updated with key past experiences and lessons learned for future reference and
                        improvements, as previously discussed on the problem management process
                        section.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Another alternative to consider
                        is to have a ticketing tool instead of an SDM tool if focus will be set on
                        fault restoral and less on problem or change management. This will be further
                        discussed in section 5.2.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">When choosing the appropriate
                        tool, one point to consider is the scheme of collaboration between the NaaS NOC
                        with the tenant NOCs. An automated mode will require the SDM/ticketing tool to
                        communicate to the tenant NOCs. In this scenario, the tool must support a
                        standardized interface towards the tenant NOC for easier and automatic TT
                        sharing.</p>

                        Network Fault Management System</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">A NOC needs a visible medium to
                        monitor alarms which is accomplished by a network fault management system or network
                        monitoring system as described in the Network Monitoring Architecture module.
                        This tool, along with the service desk management tool covered earlier, are the
                        heart of any NOC organization. This tool enables the network surveillance
                        function, as alarms are monitored and observed by the NOC technicians, and
                        therefore ticketed for resolution following event and incident management processes.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This tool provides the NOC tier 1
                        team basic alarm functionality to acknowledge alarms (i.e., mark an alarm as
                        observed and being analyzed), journal alarms (i.e., introduce text to the alarm
                        indicating trouble ticket opened, or change associated to alarm, or other
                        information deemed necessary) and clear alarms (i.e., set an alarm as already
                        worked and dismissible from further work).</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">There are two common options
                        commonly available for NOCs regarding fault management tools: one of them is
                        having an umbrella network management system. An umbrella system helps the
                        NOC organization by having all alarms, regardless of the network element
                        vendor, available for monitoring on a single tool. This type of tools can
                        interact with the service desk management tool to create tickets directly from

                        and MNOs). If customer MNOs and NaaS agreed to automate the process, the fault
                        alarms should be shared automatically between systems by a directly connected
                        interface. Its important to note that not all the fault alarms should be
                        shared, but only those relevant to customer MNO service.</p>

                        Network Configuration Management System</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This system helps the NOC to
                        oversee the configurations of the network equipment in a centralized fashion.
                        This is helpful for teams responsible for change management or for teams in
                        charge of troubleshooting.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Configuration management tools
                        have three main advantages: to help keep the network configuration consistent,
                        to ease the problem solving, and to allow the automation of the network. These
                        tools help to keep the consistency of the network since any difference in the
                        configuration for similar equipment can be spotted and corrected more easily.
                        It also aids the change management teams to monitor the changes on the
                        equipment in near real-time. Regarding the problem-solving process, having the
                        configuration files centralized and updated may reduce the time to provide a
                        solution. Lastly, these tools allow a network to be partially or fully
                        automated since having a centralized tool for configuration is the first step
                        towards network orchestration and automation.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">As stated in previous sections,
                        the collaboration with tenant NOCs is key for effective work. Similarly, if
                        agreed by the Naas and customer NOCs, it can be necessary the direct connection
                        between the configuration management systems (e.g., through APIs, SNMP Traps,
                        or standardized interfaces). It is important to note that not all the
                        configurations should be shared, but only those relevant to a certain MNO.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Finally, it is important to note
                        that the NMS tools from different vendors can act as network configuration management
                        tools. The obvious limitation is that an NMS will only work for the equipment
                        from that vendor (some vendors would require more than one NMS tool). If the
                        NaaS Operator Network is built of equipment from several vendors, the number of
                        NMS tools will increase accordingly.</p>

                        operational tools will be discussed, followed by optional support tools.</p>
                        
                        <h3><a></a>5.2.1
                        Critical Operational Tools</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">There are a couple of tools that
                        are critical and must be part of the NOC solution: the network fault management
                        tool, the service desk management tool and configuration management tool. The
                        first one is the key component of network surveillance and event management;
                        the second one is vital for incident management and fault management teams; and
                        the third is vital for change management and fault management teams. Below the
                        recommendations and considerations to be taken into account by the NaaS operators
                        for the selection of these tools are provided:</p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
                            <li><b>Network Fault Management Tool</b><br>
                            An umbrella network fault management tool would be ideal
                            for any NOC organization, as it would enable the NOC tier 1 team to monitor all
                            network alarms from one single instance. However, there are two variables that
                            need to be considered for this type of tool. The first variable is
                            financial-oriented: budget constraints might prevent the operator from choosing
                            this alternative as commercial tools are costly not only from an acquisition
                            perspective but also from a maintenance perspective.
                            <br>The second variable is process-oriented: full
                            implementation of this type of tools requires a heavy use of EMS
                            configurations, and on top of that, the actual tool needs to be configured and
                            optimized, along with training for its effective use.
                            <br>A simpler, more cost-effective solution is to have the NOC tier
                            1 team to monitor alarms directly from each of the EMSes on the network. This
                            of course translates into a more complex scenario for the NOC engineer as
                            multiple tools need to be opened at the same time, and multiple windows need to
                            be monitored simultaneously. This also means that NOC technicians need to be
                            trained in each tool separately to be familiarized with each tool.</li>
                        
                            <li><b>Service Desk Management Tool</b><br>
                            A full service desk management
                            tool can be of great aid for the NOC team, as it would benefit from having all
                            associated tickets in one single tool (incident management, problem management,
                            change management). This translates into a more agile organization, as all teams
                            speak the same language and know the same reference.<br>
                            As mentioned before there are free SDM tools available in
                            the market, and some of them have open trials that can benefit a starting
                            organization as the team can get used to the interface and the way of working
                            before considering some of the commercial offerings surrounding such tools.<br>
                            One important factor to consider for the SDM tool
                            incorporation is to review the actual processes that will be run by the NOC.
                            While the NOC will adhere to some form of event, incident and change management,
                            there is an area that needs to be reviewed like problem management.<br>
                            If the organization will not consider having this process
                            in place, both problem tickets and the need for a knowledge base can be set
                            aside, lessening the requirement for a full SDM tool. There are some
                            organizations that use simpler tools like Microsoft Excel for change management
                            (keeping records and control of all change activities), and incident management
                            can be realized via a simpler ticketing system.</li>

                            <b>Network Configuration Management
                            Tool</b><br>As previously stated, the use of tools for network management
                            helps the NOC team to monitor the consistency of the configuration of the
                            network. It delivers to the organization the fastest and smoothest transition
                            to a full orchestrated network.<br>These tools will enable a NaaS operator to react faster to
                            changes in their network without impacting the agreed SLAs because it allows
                            near real-time monitoring of the configuration. It also helps to have better documentation
                            and organization in terms of change management and backup.</li>

                        GIS and the network performance tools will be discussed, which are support
                        tools that are optional depending on the needs of the NaaS operator.</p>

                            <li><b>GIS Tool</b><br>While a full-fledged GIS tool can bring several
                            opportunities for an organization  not only from an operational level, but
                            also for network and capacity planning or deployment  there are other options
                            available that are less robust or that offer fewer features but still get the
                            job done from a NOC perspective.<br>
                            While some of those options have been presented in the previous section, bear in mind a well-crafted
                            spreadsheet can offer at some extent some of the benefits for a NOC tier 1 team
                            without the costs associated to a GIS tool purchase and configuration.</li>
                            <li><b>Network Performance Management Tool</b><br>
                            A network performance management system brings value to an
                            organization that considers performance management and problem management into
                            their core functions and processes. <br>This type of tools can be greatly beneficial for a NOC team
                            as they enable organizations to be aware of performance degradations as they
                            occur, and often aid such investigations speeding up resolution times. Still,
                            if the NaaS operator decides to start operations without such focus on performance
                            management then the use of this tool becomes obsolete for the NOC.</li>

                        available for NOC staffing that can be considered by the NaaS operator: insourcing
                        (i.e., building the NOC with internal resources as part of the NaaS organization)
                        and outsourcing (i.e., reaching out to a third party to take control of
                        operations), both of which will be covered in more detail in the next

                        outlined in this document in the previous sections, and the operator will have
                        to define the implementation strategy that best fits their organization taking
                        all these factors into consideration.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">A closer examination of the implementation
                        alternatives is presented below:</p>

                            <li><b>Insourced Model</b><br>The insourced model consists of the NaaS operator
                            establishing their own NOC, taking full control of all operation and
                            maintenance activities and functions for their network. An own consolidated and
                            centralized hub for network control can transform the NOC into an engine for
                            revenue growth and an area for competitive differentiation for an operator.<br>
                            In the insourced model, the NaaS operator sets all the
                            structure, functions, processes and tools that will be incorporated into their NOC
                            solution. All documentation, planning and reporting will be tackled by the
                            organization as well.<br>
                            Insourcing implies that all NOC staff will be evaluated,
                            selected, and onboarded by the NaaS operator, starting with the management team
                            all the way down to the engineers performing each function at the NOC. This
                            also means that the Naas operator will have to cope and plan for attrition as
                            well as to plan and schedule for training needs (for network architecture,
                            network technology and governing processes).</li>
                            
                            <li><b>Outsourced Model</b><br>
                            For the outsourced model, the NaaS operator brings a third
                            party to perform all associated activities related to the operation &amp;
                            maintenance of the network. Looking for a NOC service provider means that the
                            operator will need to find a company that has the capability to monitor their
                            network environment. All the aspects that were mentioned in the previous section will now fall into the NOC providers
                            hands.<br>Outsourcing offers relief from the staffing and skills
                            dilemma, allowing organizations to attain almost instant network expertise for
                            maximizing network performance.<br>When an operator chooses to outsource their NOC, along the
                            contracts and agreements made between both companies, the operator can set the
                            requirements for all aspects of the operation, such as the structure to be
                            followed, the functions and processes to be put in place and a recommendation
                            for the tools to be incorporated as part of the providers solution.<br>
                            Some of the questions that the NaaS Operator should make to
                            the potential partners are:<br>
                        
                            <ol class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in;font-size: 16px;' start=1 type='a'>
                                <li class="normal-text">What is the location of their NOC?
                                Potential considerations include communication/language/cultural difficulties,
                                service lag times, outage response times that accompany hiring off-shore or
                                near-shore providers.</li>

                                <li class="normal-text">Can they scale to support the NaaS operator
                                business? Major advantages of outsourcing include flexibility and scalability
                                and these capabilities should be considered from the start.</li>
                        
                                <li class="normal-text">Is their staff on-call or on-site? What
                                type of coverage solutions do they offer? If the NaaS operator decides to
                                outsource network monitoring for full 24x7 coverage, they have to realize some
                                providers support their customers via an on-call rotation, which may not suit
                                the response times needed.</li>
                        
                                <li class="normal-text">How will their NOC access NaaS operators
                                network? Seek for high-availability redundancy options as monitoring is crucial
                                and the NaaS operator cannot afford to have gaps in coverage due to unforeseen
                                circumstances.</li>
                                
                                <li class="normal-text">Is their platform flexible and
                                customizable, or restricted to out-of-the-box functionality? The systems should
                                have the advantage of being customizable, satisfying the NaaS operators
                                specific needs.</li>
                                
                                <li class="normal-text">Does the NOC provider outsource any of
                                the assigned tasks? Some outsourced providers may in turn outsource part of the
                                tasks they have been contracted for. Subcontractors should follow the same
                                obligations acquired by the service provider.</li>
                                <li class="normal-text">How does the NOC alert and handle
                                outage escalations? Flexibility could involve different modes of outage
                                notification depending on when the event occurs: an email or SMS on normal
                                working hours, and an emergency phone call after normal working hours.</li>
                                <li class="normal-text">How long does it take to implement the
                                outsourced solution? Once agreements are in place, will the provider need weeks
                                or months before they can have the NOC up and running?</li>

                            <li><b>Mixed Model</b><br>A mixed solution can also be put in place by the NaaS
                            operator and a third party. In this alternative, the NaaS operator chooses
                            which tasks will have to be fulfilled by the external provider and which ones
                            the NaaS operator will assume. This may make sense in an environment in which a
                            multi-vendor distributed network may present difficulties for the operator to
                            acquire the experienced personnel needed and chooses to outsource some parts of
                            the network, therefore.</li>

                        <p class="normal-text">The insourced model offers full
                        control of the operations to the NaaS Operator, allowing for changes in
                        process/functions to be completed according to the business needs as soon as
                        possible. Compared to the costs associated with the outsourcing model, the insourced
                        model offers a way to drive down costs as needed.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">However, insourcing may render
                        difficulties for the NaaS operator as all hiring and training must be performed
                        by them. Because of this, the insourced model is recommended for mature
                        organizations with good human resources practices in place and confidence in
                        the tools/processes to be implemented or for NaaS operators with small networks
                        and tight budget constraints.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The outsourced model is often a
                        costly option, still it offers several benefits as the NaaS operator is
                        liberated from all the HR burden, including training and retaining highly
                        skilled professionals, as well as tool selection and implementation. This is
                        often one of the most difficult scenarios, especially at the beginning of
                        operations, as NOC engineers have to learn at first a networks architecture
                        and technology, the entire range of processes built around the NOC, and tool
                        utilization.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">A NaaS operator should select the
                        outsourced model if the costs associated with outsourcing outweigh the costs
                        associated to having an operation that is not working properly or that is not
                        mature enough.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The mixed schema is suitable for
                        NaaS operators that have maturity in certain aspects of the operation but are
                        struggling in other areas, or for operator facing a multi-vendor distributed
                        network experiencing difficulties to hire personnel with the right skills and
                        knowledge for such challenge, as the third party can assist the operator
                        fulfilling such gaps while the company gains such knowledge and skills.</p>

                        operator will always rely on a close relationship with other MNOs, mainly as customers.
                        Under this assumption, the NOC needs to be in constant communication with NOCs
                        from other MNOs (tenant NOCs). The collaboration strategy will focus on areas
                        on which is critical to maintain a level of communication. There are basically
                        four communication areas that need to be addressed by this strategy:</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">The collaborative strategy for
                        the NaaS operator and their customer MNOs begins with the cooperation on the event
                        management process. In this process, any alert or notification raised by any
                        service, resource or monitoring tool is reported in the form of TTs. These TTs
                        are analyzed and solved or escalated by tier 1 NOC in later steps. Ticketing is
                        the most crucial activity since it represents the main input that drives all
                        the NOC activities.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The next task in the NOC overall
                        process is the fault management on any anomaly reported by event management. In
                        this phase, the communication is vital: the faster, the better. An earlier and
                        clearer exchange of information between involved parties would lead to a
                        quicker resolution. The tier 2 and tier 3 support following the fault management
                        stage can be on the NaaS or MNO side (depending on the NOC implementation
                        model).</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The other two processes for which
                        a lower degree of integration of systems is required are performance management
                        and billing &amp; revenue reconciliation. The first refers to the constant
                        monitoring of the network looking for poor performance of the network or opportunity
                        areas where to increase the performance. The integration of performance systems
                        can lead to a better understanding of the network and cooperative measures or
                        changes can be implemented more effectively.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The last process is the billing
                        and revenue reconciliation. This stage is key towards a successful business
                        partnership between the NaaS operator and their customer MNOs. The purpose of
                        this task is to reach agreements on the periodic billing or revenue amounts
                        based on the associated costs and profits of the network operation. Again,
                        communication is the key to avoid misunderstandings and to efficient the
                        overall process.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">There are two generic modes for
                        all the integration of the communication conduits mentioned above: the manual
                        and the automated. The first is characterized by a minimum or non-existent
                        integration of the involved systems and relying on basic and slow human
                        one-to-one or one-to-many communication. The automated mode targets for almost
                        full integration of the systems. The intercommunication of these systems is based
                        on automatic request and replies which lead to a near-real-time interaction.</p>

                        is one of the pillars for NOC activities, so it is a mandatory item in the
                        collaboration strategy. The purpose of this system integration is the fast and
                        clear exchange of information for any irregularity in the network or the
                        service. For any NaaS operator, this is mandatory for a healthy relationship
                        with their customer MNOs.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">There are several advantages when
                        implementing an efficient ticketing process: reduction in the response times
                        when an abnormality in the services/network occurs and decreasing of the
                        overhead for the MNOs when opening a ticket. The disadvantage would be that the
                        integration of systems can be hard to achieve when the already implemented
                        tools do not allow this option.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">This scheme avoids the system
                        integration with ticketing from tenant NOCs. The tenant NOCs may have
                        independent tools from NaaS operator, and no special feature or interface is
                        needed. The collaboration is via phone calls or formal emails. When an email or
                        phone call takes place to open a TT, the NaaS Operator NOC personnel must
                        manually insert the details into their SDM/ticketing system. This method could
                        lead to errors in capturing the details of the problem besides the long times
                        for reporting.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">The SDM/ticketing systems are
                        interconnected so the TT can be raised directly by the customer MNO and the
                        NaaS operator NOC can initiate the process towards the solution. After the
                        resolution of the problem, the NOC can close the created ticket and the tenant
                        NOCs are informed of the outcome almost instantly. An example of this system is
                        a web- or cloud-based ticketing.</p>

                        Fault Management</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Fault management is the second
                        pillar of NOC functionality and mandatory in the collaborative strategy. The
                        system integration objective is to reduce the necessary time for problem
                        solving and escalation time towards the compliance of pre-agreed SLAs.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The advantages and disadvantages
                        are quite like the ones of ticketing due to the closeness of these two
                        processes. It reduces the time for problem-solving since it offers alarms and
                        diagnostic elements almost instantaneously. Furthermore, it enables the
                        operator to have a shared source of truth and optimizes the overall process by
                        eliminating points of human failure. On the other side, although the
                        integration of FM systems is more feasible (compared to the ticketing), it is
                        not always possible due to lack of compatible interfaces. It is required that
                        the interfaces for interconnection are compatible from system to system.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">In the manual mode, the fault management
                        systems are not interconnected and the exchange of information such as alarms
                        of network/service is done by sharing a compendium of alarms files if the tool
                        allows it. These files can be shared by email or any other formal channel.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text"><b>Automated Mode</b></p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">When the systems are
                        interconnected and the alarms &amp; notifications are delivered automatically
                        between the fault management tools, the information of the alarm is not
                        modified, and the integrity is preserved. The update of the notification is in
                        real-time and the analysis of the issue is done with no delays. The fault management
                        tool uses a request/response paradigm to communicate through standardized
                        interfaces (e.g., SNMP traps, API exposure, NETCONF protocol based). Examples
                        of these are umbrella tools and the interconnection of EMS/OSS systems.</p>

                        Performance Monitoring</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Performance Monitoring has less
                        criticality since it is an extended function of the NOC and can be considered
                        as optional. Here, the purpose of the integration is to draw more attention on
                        the performance KPIs so its easier to find areas of opportunity for
                        enhancements of the network.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The advantages are that more
                        people can analyze the performance KPIs and it is more likely to find a root
                        problem or any improvement in the usage of the network. The disadvantage would
                        be that the integration is more challenging to achieve than the previous systems
                        since, in this case, the access should permit MNOs to only access their own
                        KPIs. If access is not properly controlled, a privacy issue may be raised. In
                        this case, the access management is more challenging since the permissions have
                        more precise delimitations.</p>

                        the exposure of the KPIs may be done through periodic reports or presentations.
                        Since it is not a mandatory requirement, these reports may not always be shared
                        and should be requested via formal email or phone call. This process would
                        require a certain degree of organization between the NaaS operator and the
                        involved MNO. It also needs more human effort into generating these
                        reports/presentations according to the total number of MNOs.</p>

                        integration is achieved by connecting the system tools to share the appropriate
                        KPIs to the corresponding MNOs. One MNO should only have permission to look
                        into the KPIs that are relevant to it. The coordination between tools should be
                        more precise, but the results are the monitoring of the network performance in

                        Billing and Revenue Reconciliation</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">On the business side, the
                        collaboration strategy contemplates the reconciliation of billing and, when it
                        applies, revenue. The purpose of the integration of this system is to assure
                        the data integrity and provide clarity of the billing and revenue. This must be
                        considered mandatory to the collaborative strategy since the heart of the
                        relationship between the NaaS operator and their customer MNO is
                        business-based.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The pros of having these systems
                        integrated are that the data used for billing and revenue clarifications is
                        unmodified as a unified source of truth. Moreover, continuous monitoring can
                        lead to better business estimations without the need of waiting for the
                        periodic reports. The con is that data must be selected before shared with MNOs
                        to avoid any information leak to other MNOs. This would also involve the
                        overseeing of access to the systems involved.</p>

                        reconciliation is done by periodic meetings with business areas from a specific
                        MNO. The MNO and the NaaS operator need to have implemented independent tools
                        to have a formal discussion if the processed billing data differ. In this
                        scheme, the human effort is increased by the number of MNO, since a customized
                        report and an isolated meeting should be carried out per MNO.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">The automated mode considers the
                        integration of the billing systems at BSS level. The information is
                        pre-processed only to select the pertinent information to be shared per MNO. A
                        formal meeting is always a good practice when billing data differs. Here, the
                        BSS has more standardized interfaces towards other BSS, so the integrations are
                        easier.</p>

                        management is optional, a standard periodic reporting is enough. Finally, the
