                        the key metrics and the relevance/need for each function.</p>
                        
                        <h3><a></a>3.1.1 Network Surveillance</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Network surveillance is the first
                        and most vital function that is supported by a NOC. NOC staff performs
                        continuous monitoring of all the network elements, using available tools like a
                        network monitoring system (see Network Monitoring Architecture module) or via
                        the different element management systems (EMS) provided by equipment vendors.
                        In addition, the NaaS Operator must grant limited access to these systems to
                        the MNO NOCs to monitor only the elements of the network related to their
                        users.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">For those network or performance
                        alarms detected, NOC staff will conduct preliminary filtering (such as
                        correlation, alarms due to planned work, etc.), open the corresponding trouble
                        ticket (TT), monitor the alarm warnings, categorize/prioritize the alert
                        severity and handle the problem escalation according to defined procedures.
                        During this stage, a constant communication between the tenant NOCs and the
                        NaaS operator NOC will lead to a better categorization, filtering and avoidance
                        of unnecessary TT.</p>

                        compatibility may be an issue, a primitive method could be used such as phone

                            measured against each severity category (critical, major, medium, minor). This
                            can also be categorized per MNO, depending on the opener.</li>

                            1 team on initial fault isolation and diagnosis before escalating the ticket to
                            the corresponding fix agent. This can also be categorized per MNO, depending on
                            the TT opener.</li>

                        interconnected to minimize communication time. One implementation option is to
                        connect the fault management systems from the NaaS operator and customer MNOs
                        using open interfaces. In this case, the NaaS operator must limit the MNOs
                        access to prevent exposing the complete network metrics or KPIs due to privacy
                        issues.</p>

                        staff, it will be escalated to tier 3 support which for most NaaS operators
                        will consist of requesting direct support from equipment vendors.</p>

                        alternative is to rely on the tier 2 and/or tier 3 from them. This would
                        decrease the required budget for the NaaS operator NOC and shorten the
                        implementation time. However, an agreement must be reached first with customer
                        MNOs. This tactic will be further reviewed in sections 6.4 and 6.5.</p>

                        based on the permissions that the NaaS operator will grant to the customer MNOs
                        to access their systems. In a similar vein, the NaaS operator NOC would require
                        permission to access the systems of the tenant NOCs so the level of access must
                        be conceded accordingly. These considerations should be handled by the OSS

                        <p class="normal-text">As stated before, the tier 1 team
                        is the first point of contact when an issue in the network arises. However, the
                        configuration of functions for this team can vary based on the NaaS operator
                        requirements and constraints. The sections below, provide an overview and
                        guidance for NaaS operators to select the option that best suits their needs.</p>

                        Network Surveillance + Fault Management Scenario</h4>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The aggregation of network surveillance
                        and fault management is one of the most common scenarios at the tier 1 level.
                        Since network surveillance and fault management tier 1 go hand-by-hand, these
                        two functions are usually met by one single instance which is accommodated into
                        a NOC tier 1 level. This group of people will both perform real-time
                        monitoring of all alarms, create trouble tickets, perform first-level analysis
                        and diagnosis, and escalate the ticket to the corresponding fix agent if unable
                        to resolve.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The group will also be
                        responsible for all email and phone call communications regarding the tier 1
                        team, including exchanges for site conditions, active alarms, and network alarm
                        status.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">NaaS operators should select this
                        option if a high volume of alarms/tickets is not expected, or if they wish to
                        keep both functions tied to a single team in order for the tier 1 team to have
                        a complete picture of both alarms and trouble tickets.</p>
                        
                        <h4><a></a>3.2.1.2
                        Region Segmentation Scenario</h4>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Another common setup revolves
                        around aggregating the access management and field dispatch functions into the tier
                        1 team as well. This can prove effective when the NOC is monitoring a small
                        network (or if network monitoring is broken up into different regions, each one
                        covered by a small team of engineers).</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">In this scenario, the tier 1 team
                        will also be in charge of executing field dispatches (if necessary) and making
                        the necessary adjustments to make sure that there will be access to the site
                        for the field technicians.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">As mentioned before, this option
                        is best suited for region-based monitoring or for small networks, as the
                        increase in functions makes them aware of all details for their respective
                        sites, but in turn, the overhead associated with this setup may challenge the
                        team.</p>
                        
                        <h4><a></a>3.2.1.3
                        Domain Segmentation Scenario</h4>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Another common scenario is to
                        have the NOC tier 1 team segmented into the different network domains,
                        typically RAN, TX and CORE, especially if the alarm volume expected will be
                        high. As such, each team monitors and creates trouble tickets for the alarms
                        coming in from the different network elements in each domain.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">For instance, the RAN tier 1 team
                        monitoring a 4G network would receive alarms from the eNBs and the cell site routers,
                        working closely with site-level fix agents, like field technicians covering
                        such sites, tower companies, power companies and fiber companies. The TX tier 1
                        team would receive alarms from the IP aggregation and backbone routers, working
                        with field technicians, power companies and fiber service providers. Finally,
                        the CORE tier 1 team would receive alarms coming from the EPC network elements
                        like the MME, SGW, PGW, etc.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This setup is more complex than
                        the previous one, as all tier 1 teams must be in constant communication and
                        coordination to successfully correlate alarms to incidents within the network.
                        Some operators choose to have only two tier 1 teams: access (including all RAN
                        and aggregation nodes) and CORE. These segmented scenarios make more sense to
                        operators with medium-to-large site presence and can be combined with the
                        previous region segmentation mentioned earlier for better results in larger,
                        nation-wide networks.</p>
                        
                        <h4><a></a>3.2.1.4
                        Enhanced Tier 1 Scenario</h4>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Finally, one less common setup is
                        incorporating fault management tier 2 functions to the NOC tier 1 team in
                        addition to the previously mentioned functions. This is referred to as a tier
                        1.5 team, or enhanced tier 1 team.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This option may be taken for
                        budget constraints as there would only be one team overseeing, analyzing, and
                        processing all activities within the network, escalating complex cases directly
                        to the vendors. This setup requires engineers with a higher level of expertise
                        which must be taken into consideration. This can be an option for small
                        networks with more relaxed service level agreements, as cases escalated to
                        vendors may extend resolution times. </p>

                        <p class="normal-text">Each NOC group is usually
                        supervised by a manager who delivers guidance to the entire team and serves as
                        the point of contact (POC) for all those team requirements or escalations.
                        Depending on the setup that has been chosen, leaders for network surveillance, fault
                        management tier 1, fault management tier 2, performance management, OSS &amp; tools
                        management, access management, incident management and field dispatch may exist;
                        or a manager for the aggregated teams may be in place (e.g., NOC tier 1 manager,
                        NOC tier 2 manager). The entire team is supervised by a NOC head, who acts as
                        the ultimate responsible for the NOC operations.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Another common practice in
                        medium-to-large NOC organizations is to have a manager per domain, specifically
                        at the tier 2 level. This decision is based on the expertise that is needed for
                        such teams and to have a direct escalation path available for specific-domain scenarios
                        that may be present on the network, thus aiding for faster resolutions since the
                        leader can provide directions for the team and readjusting priorities as
                        needed.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Since regardless of the grouping
                        decisions the tier 1 team is always one of the biggest groups, team leaders are
                        regularly set as part of the structure (having at least one team leader per
                        shift). These people are trained engineers whose expertise and process
                        knowledge, supported by leadership empowerment, enables them to make controlled
                        operative decisions during their shift in absence of the teams manager.</p>

                            a network event or a customer MNO ticket. In the case of a network event, an
                            alarm goes into a network monitoring system (NMS). At this stage, the alarm
                            message is displayed in the EMS, and thus it appears on the screen of the fault

                            network change implementation, and rollout activities. Next, the FM tier 1
                            engineer would contact the person implementing the planned work to determine if
                            the alarm is related to the activities. If it is, and if the activities were
                            planned, the FM engineer will update the alarm and acknowledge it. This will
                            remove the alarm from the current view. </li>

                            work, the engineer moves on to the next process step: correlate incident. In
                            correlate incident, the engineer searches alarm criteria to correlate the
                            alarm with any similar alarms already recorded in incident tickets. If the
                            event is correlated, the engineer updates the incident ticket with the alarm or
                            event that was just correlated.</li>

                        a decision to either reject the change and stop the process or approve the

                        preparations and adjust the timing between a normal change and a standard
                        change. The next decision point is based on whether the change is a simple change

                        coordination of NaaS and MNO NOCs (b), which is the responsibility of the change
                        coordinator. As the change coordinator is working, the change implementer is

                        the change implementer needs to be in contact with the network monitoring team
                        in the NOC. The network monitoring team should be in contact with their
                        counterparts in the tenant NOCs. This contact is necessary to ask the fault management

                        or even an outage caused by the change itself. In any of these cases, the NOC

                        the change implementation can finish on time or if a rollback is necessary to

                        the NOC has the authority to request the
                        status of the activities on customer MNOs networks to correlate with the
                        status of its own network. If the impact if bigger than expected, the NaaS Operator

                        <p class="normal-text">Corrective Maintenance can be triggered by the preventive
                        inspections which detect that corrective actions are required and will require
                        service interruption such as cabling replacement. However corrective actions
                        are triggered as well in case of unexpected failures. In this case, the
                        Dispatcher/ Field Manager releases a work order which Field Technicians must
                        review and understand before departure to the site. The following subsections
                        include a high-level overview of the key tasks
                        that the field maintenance team may perform before, during and after corrective
                        actions. </p>

                        triggered when an alarm is detected by the NOC. Field technicians must analyze
                        the Antenna System elements looking for faulty components. The best practice is
                        to start looking for faults that require lower impact repairs, considering
                        hardware replacements as the last option.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Hardware replacement in the Antenna system requires special
                        attention since it may require the use of a pulley and winch to replace the
                        Radio Units, Antennas or Structural supports. Additionally, its recommended
                        that at least three people work together to perform a radio or antenna
                        replacement. Field Management must ensure the availability of these resources.</p>

                        Maintenance History which accurately leads to failure prevention and drives

                        a Service Management Tool, or storing the reports that are generated manually.
                        The analysis to properly select the Reporting method is deeply analyzed in the
