                            NOC, and the scope for each team, highlighting relevance and potential impact
                            for NaaS operators.</p>

                            SOC Overview</a></h2>
                            
                            <p class="normal-text">A SOC is often seen as an
                            evolution from the NOC. The NOC's objective is to monitor the performance of
                            the network by rectifying equipment/transmission/power faults. This is the
                            network-centric approach that is originally associated with the NOC
                            organization. The NOC is mainly measured by the availability and performance of
                            the overall network. </p>
                            
                            <p class="normal-text">However, to differentiate in the
                            marketplace, network operators saw the need to deliver superior services to
                            their subscribers. Thus, the SOC aims to transition from network-centric
                            operations to service-centric operations: instead of optimizing the network for
                            improved performance per network domain alone, service-centric operations aim
                            to optimize the network for improved performance across each service. </p>
                            
                            <p class="normal-text">The SOC main responsibilities
                            include:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
                                <li>Improve the availability, performance, and integrity of network services</li>
                                <li>Gain visibility into and manage the E2E customer experience </li>
                                <li>Reduce service downtime</li>
                                <li>Improve the end-user service experience</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p class="normal-text">As stated
                            before, the objective of a SOC is to transform operations from network-oriented
                            to service- and customer-centric. This is enabled by modeling and developing an
                            E2E view of key prioritized services which drive customer experience (e.g.,
                            mobile data speed) and then driving proactive operational actions based on
                            real-time service and customer insights, focusing on the correlation of service
                            performance alerts, network element faults and probing data to quickly locate
                            issues, prioritizing workload based on service impact and affected customers.</p>
                            
                            <p class="normal-text">Such a transformed approach helps
                            to diagnose and restore network service degradations faster, and aids to
                            identify areas of potential capacity constraints therefore improving service
                            usage due to higher accessibility and quality. </p>
                            
                            <p class="normal-text">While the NOC delivers an operational
                            business impact (ensuring network uptime, reducing mean-time-to-restore (MTTR)
                            for network faults and improving geographical coverage), the SOC delivers a
                            strategic business impact by reducing potential revenue loss and improving
                            customer satisfaction. </p>
                            
                            <p class="normal-text">It's important to mention that
                            the SOC organization depends on the NOC, which functions as the baseline for
                            all network activities, and the SOC feeds from network status and conditions
                            provided by the NOC to improve customer experience. The operator can always
                            choose to have a NOC organization alone, especially for small-sized networks,
                            in financially constrained environments, and/or when the NaaS operator does not
                            implement the E2E service.</p>
                            
                            <p class="normal-text">However, if the NaaS operator
                            decides not to implement a SOC solution from the start of operations, the SOC
                            solution can be implemented afterward if demanded by customer MNOs or to
                            improve performance after the NaaS operator has positioned in the market.</p>

                                the service monitoring
                                team, reviewed with the NOC for fault
                                correlation, and escalated to the service support tier 2 team '
                                if applicable ' for
                                analysis and resolution.</li>

                                on high impact incidents until resolution, coordinating efforts between the NOC
                                and the SOC teams. Incident managers are also
                                part of the NOC solution, and the operator can choose to have one incident manager per
                                organization or an incident manager for both NOC and SOC organizations.</li>

                                degradations. Problem managers are also part
                                of the NOC solution, and are quite common to
                                have them supervising both NOC- and SOC-generated fault and service problem
                                tickets.</li>

                                are responsible for the coordination and implementation of all changes in the
                                network, considering the impact to
                                end-subscribers. Change managers are also part
                                of the NOC solution, and usually they control both NOC- and SOC-generated
                                changes.</li>
                                
                                <li>Performance managers overview performance or quality degradation
                                problems on the network or the different services running in the network. The performance team renders reports and investigations for both
                                NOC and SOC structures.</li>
                                
                                <li>The OSS &amp; tools team supervises all the tools used within the network,
                                regardless of which team is using the tool (i.e., NOC, SOC or both)</li>

                        the first function that must be executed in a SOC, as the services that will be

                        (KPIs), and then modeled into a tool for monitoring and trending purposes. A
                        recommendation for the NaaS operator is to revisit section 2.2 of the <a>$$link_widget$$Network
                        Monitoring Architecture module</a> for a list of KPIs to take into

                        Customer Care + Service Monitoring Scenario</h4>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Aggregating functions for a team
                        within a department or organization is a way to customize such an entity,
                        usually looking for optimization opportunities. One alternative for aggregation
                        of functions for a SOC organization is performed at the SOC tier 1 level.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">As the customer care team is the
                        first point of contact for all end customer queries, serving as a service desk
                        solution for the SOC organization, and the service monitoring team is aware of
                        all service degradations being investigated, both functions can be incorporated
                        into one single entity.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This group of people will be in
                        charge of performing real-time monitoring of services, create TTs, perform
                        first-level analysis and diagnosis, and escalate the ticket to the
                        corresponding fix agent if unable to resolve, while also receiving and
                        responding to end customer queries or complaints. This structure enables faster
                        responses for end customer queries as the team is aware of all service
                        degradation conditions on the network.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The NaaS operator can choose this
                        option if a high volume of calls or customer queries is not expected, since an
                        overflow of customer complaints could jeopardize the monitoring function. In
                        addition, if the NaaS operator seeks to improve resolution times, this option
                        is also a good choice since the same group that is monitoring services responds
                        directly to customers, skipping the communication lapses that normally occur
                        when the functions are separated on different teams.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Another possibility is to
                        consider the automation of certain functions related to customer care and
                        service monitoring through available tools in the market. If this is done the
                        right way, resources can handle both customer care and service monitoring even
                        for a high volume of customer queries.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">A second alternative for
                        aggregation of functions is incorporating the service monitoring and the
                        service support tier 2 functions in one single team, creating as such one
                        single instance that will be in charge of all service-related cases that are
                        identified on the network. This team would then be in charge of performing
                        real-time monitoring of services, creating trouble tickets, performing first
                        and second level analysis and diagnosis, and escalating the ticket to the
                        vendor's support team directly if they are unable to resolve the case.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This setup requires engineers
                        with a tier 2 profile, since a higher level of expertise is required for the
                        engineers assigned for this team.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This option is only recommended
                        for small networks where a few services (no more than three) will be monitored,
                        as there would be just one entity within the SOC structure monitoring such
                        services and performing analysis and diagnosis on open cases. Having a varied
                        set of services may compromise the team effectiveness. However, if analytics
                        and automation tools are implemented, this option can still be considered due
                        to the efficiencies obtained through these tools.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">1)
                        Input triggers can come in the form of
                        a service degradation
                        event or a customer care ticket. The alert from a service degradation event
                        will be used for reference. This condition is alerted via a network performance management tool or a service
                        quality management
                        tool. At this stage, the degradation is visible in one of the tools mentioned
                        earlier for service monitoring tier 1 engineers.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">2)
                        The engineer then verifies if the
                        degradation can be correlated to a network event. In this phase the service
                        monitoring engineer checks with the NOC FM tier 1 engineer for a possible relationship between the
                        detected degradation and a generated alarm or event in the network, as well as
                        to verify other activities such as preventative
                        maintenance, network
                        change implementation,
                        and rollout activities. If the degradation is related to a network event, then
                        the NOC event management
                        process will take over and may move onto the next process, NOC incident management which
                        is analyzed in the <a>$$link_widget$$NOC Module</a>.
                        It is important to note that this process could be
                        automated using the right service desk management and service quality management tools, reducing
                        the workload of NOC resources.</p>

                        If the degradation is not related to a
                        network event, the engineer moves on to the next process step: 'assess impact to the
                        end user.' In this
                        step, the engineer verifies what the actual impact to end users is in order to communicate it to them before complaints are received. The impact could also be
                        estimated automatically through a service quality management tool.
                        See section 5 for further guidance.</p>

                        In 'correlate
                        incident,' the engineer searches active
                        incidents to correlate the event with any similar ongoing events already
                        recorded in incident tickets. If the event is
                        correlated, the engineer updates the incident ticket with the scenario that was
                        just correlated. </p>

                        faults/alarms in the case of the NOC. The SOC event management process stops
                        when the service degradation detected is derived from a fault/alarm that has
                        already been acknowledged from the NOC and will be resolved by the NOC incident

                        <p class="normal-text">There are several tools in place
                        for a NOC to achieve its objectives. The most widely used are the service desk management
                        tool, a network fault management system, a geographic information system, network
                        performance management system and network configuration management systems.
                        These will be reviewed in the following sections.</p>
                        
                        <h3><a></a>5.1.1
                        Service Desk Management Tool</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This tool is used for the
                        documentation of all incidents, problems and changes that are being worked on
                        the network at any given time. It can be considered one of the main tools used
                        by the NOC, as it enables all the team to have a proper mechanism to document
                        all activities surrounding each incident, problem or change ticket.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">A proper tool for documentation
                        aids the team as they can know exactly what the status of any ticket is, what
                        are the next items to be solved and what needs to be followed-up. It also
                        enables reporting, which serves as the basis for governance activities:
                        revision of the NOC performance, KPIs, and SLAs.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">A full service desk management
                        (SDM) tool is an immensely powerful tool that incorporates modules for incident
                        management (incident tickets), problem management (problem tickets) and change management
                        (change tickets). It also includes a Knowledge Base module (KB Articles) that
                        serves as a repository for all the KB information used by all NOC teams,
                        updated with key past experiences and lessons learned for future reference and
                        improvements, as previously discussed on the problem management process
                        section.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Another alternative to consider
                        is to have a ticketing tool instead of an SDM tool if focus will be set on
                        fault restoral and less on problem or change management. This will be further
                        discussed in section 5.2.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">When choosing the appropriate
                        tool, one point to consider is the scheme of collaboration between the NaaS NOC
                        with the tenant NOCs. An automated mode will require the SDM/ticketing tool to
                        communicate to the tenant NOCs. In this scenario, the tool must support a
                        standardized interface towards the tenant NOC for easier and automatic TT
                        sharing.</p>

                        free/open-source tools are provided in Table 3.</p>

                        Network Fault Management System</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">A NOC needs a visible medium to
                        monitor alarms which is accomplished by a network fault management system or network
                        monitoring system as described in the Network Monitoring Architecture module.
                        This tool, along with the service desk management tool covered earlier, are the
                        heart of any NOC organization. This tool enables the network surveillance
                        function, as alarms are monitored and observed by the NOC technicians, and
                        therefore ticketed for resolution following event and incident management processes.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This tool provides the NOC tier 1
                        team basic alarm functionality to acknowledge alarms (i.e., mark an alarm as
                        observed and being analyzed), journal alarms (i.e., introduce text to the alarm
                        indicating trouble ticket opened, or change associated to alarm, or other
                        information deemed necessary) and clear alarms (i.e., set an alarm as already
                        worked and dismissible from further work).</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">There are two common options
                        commonly available for NOCs regarding fault management tools: one of them is
                        having an umbrella network management system. An umbrella system helps the
                        NOC organization by having all alarms, regardless of the network element
                        vendor, available for monitoring on a single tool. This type of tools can
                        interact with the service desk management tool to create tickets directly from
                        the alarming tool or to append alarms directly to an existing incident ticket.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The other option is to have the tier
                        1 teams monitoring the different EMSes directly. These EMS tools have all the
                        basic functionalities needed for network surveillance (i.e., acknowledge
                        alarms, journal alarms, clear alarms).</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Like the previous section, the
                        tools from network fault management should be capable of importing and
                        exporting the alarms to synchronize the current faults of the networks (NaaS
                        and MNOs). If customer MNOs and NaaS agreed to automate the process, the fault
                        alarms should be shared automatically between systems by a directly connected
                        interface. Its important to note that not all the fault alarms should be
                        shared, but only those relevant to customer MNO service.</p>

                        Network Configuration Management System</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This system helps the NOC to
                        oversee the configurations of the network equipment in a centralized fashion.
                        This is helpful for teams responsible for change management or for teams in
                        charge of troubleshooting.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Configuration management tools
                        have three main advantages: to help keep the network configuration consistent,
                        to ease the problem solving, and to allow the automation of the network. These
                        tools help to keep the consistency of the network since any difference in the
                        configuration for similar equipment can be spotted and corrected more easily.
                        It also aids the change management teams to monitor the changes on the
                        equipment in near real-time. Regarding the problem-solving process, having the
                        configuration files centralized and updated may reduce the time to provide a
                        solution. Lastly, these tools allow a network to be partially or fully
                        automated since having a centralized tool for configuration is the first step
                        towards network orchestration and automation.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">As stated in previous sections,
                        the collaboration with tenant NOCs is key for effective work. Similarly, if
                        agreed by the Naas and customer NOCs, it can be necessary the direct connection
                        between the configuration management systems (e.g., through APIs, SNMP Traps,
                        or standardized interfaces). It is important to note that not all the
                        configurations should be shared, but only those relevant to a certain MNO.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Finally, it is important to note
                        that the NMS tools from different vendors can act as network configuration management
                        tools. The obvious limitation is that an NMS will only work for the equipment
                        from that vendor (some vendors would require more than one NMS tool). If the
                        NaaS Operator Network is built of equipment from several vendors, the number of
                        NMS tools will increase accordingly.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">In the previous section several
                        tools that are part of a NOC ecosystem were introduced. Now aspects to consider
                        for tool evaluation and selection will be presented. First, critical
                        operational tools will be discussed, followed by optional support tools.</p>
                        
                        <h3><a></a>5.2.1
                        Critical Operational Tools</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">There are a couple of tools that
                        are critical and must be part of the NOC solution: the network fault management
                        tool, the service desk management tool and configuration management tool. The
                        first one is the key component of network surveillance and event management;
                        the second one is vital for incident management and fault management teams; and
                        the third is vital for change management and fault management teams. Below the
                        recommendations and considerations to be taken into account by the NaaS operators
                        for the selection of these tools are provided:</p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
                            <li><b>Network Fault Management Tool</b><br>
                            An umbrella network fault management tool would be ideal
                            for any NOC organization, as it would enable the NOC tier 1 team to monitor all
                            network alarms from one single instance. However, there are two variables that
                            need to be considered for this type of tool. The first variable is
                            financial-oriented: budget constraints might prevent the operator from choosing
                            this alternative as commercial tools are costly not only from an acquisition
                            perspective but also from a maintenance perspective.
                            <br>The second variable is process-oriented: full
                            implementation of this type of tools requires a heavy use of EMS
                            configurations, and on top of that, the actual tool needs to be configured and
                            optimized, along with training for its effective use.
                            <br>A simpler, more cost-effective solution is to have the NOC tier
                            1 team to monitor alarms directly from each of the EMSes on the network. This
                            of course translates into a more complex scenario for the NOC engineer as
                            multiple tools need to be opened at the same time, and multiple windows need to
                            be monitored simultaneously. This also means that NOC technicians need to be
                            trained in each tool separately to be familiarized with each tool.</li>
                        
                            <li><b>Service Desk Management Tool</b><br>
                            A full service desk management
                            tool can be of great aid for the NOC team, as it would benefit from having all
                            associated tickets in one single tool (incident management, problem management,
                            change management). This translates into a more agile organization, as all teams
                            speak the same language and know the same reference.<br>
                            As mentioned before there are free SDM tools available in
                            the market, and some of them have open trials that can benefit a starting
                            organization as the team can get used to the interface and the way of working
                            before considering some of the commercial offerings surrounding such tools.<br>
                            One important factor to consider for the SDM tool
                            incorporation is to review the actual processes that will be run by the NOC.
                            While the NOC will adhere to some form of event, incident and change management,
                            there is an area that needs to be reviewed like problem management.<br>
                            If the organization will not consider having this process
                            in place, both problem tickets and the need for a knowledge base can be set
                            aside, lessening the requirement for a full SDM tool. There are some
                            organizations that use simpler tools like Microsoft Excel for change management
                            (keeping records and control of all change activities), and incident management
                            can be realized via a simpler ticketing system.</li>

                            <b>Network Configuration Management
                            Tool</b><br>As previously stated, the use of tools for network management
                            helps the NOC team to monitor the consistency of the configuration of the
                            network. It delivers to the organization the fastest and smoothest transition
                            to a full orchestrated network.<br>These tools will enable a NaaS operator to react faster to
                            changes in their network without impacting the agreed SLAs because it allows
                            near real-time monitoring of the configuration. It also helps to have better documentation
                            and organization in terms of change management and backup.</li>

                        Support Tools</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">In the following paragraphs, the
                        GIS and the network performance tools will be discussed, which are support
                        tools that are optional depending on the needs of the NaaS operator.</p>

                            <li><b>GIS Tool</b><br>While a full-fledged GIS tool can bring several
                            opportunities for an organization  not only from an operational level, but
                            also for network and capacity planning or deployment  there are other options
                            available that are less robust or that offer fewer features but still get the
                            job done from a NOC perspective.<br>
                            While some of those options have been presented in the previous section, bear in mind a well-crafted
                            spreadsheet can offer at some extent some of the benefits for a NOC tier 1 team
                            without the costs associated to a GIS tool purchase and configuration.</li>
                            <li><b>Network Performance Management Tool</b><br>
                            A network performance management system brings value to an
                            organization that considers performance management and problem management into
                            their core functions and processes. <br>This type of tools can be greatly beneficial for a NOC team
                            as they enable organizations to be aware of performance degradations as they
                            occur, and often aid such investigations speeding up resolution times. Still,
                            if the NaaS operator decides to start operations without such focus on performance
                            management then the use of this tool becomes obsolete for the NOC.</li>

                        discussion of the different scenarios available to the NaaS operator regarding
                        NOC implementation including staffing model, service levels, team dimensioning
                        and facility sizing.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">There are two main models
                        available for NOC staffing that can be considered by the NaaS operator: insourcing
                        (i.e., building the NOC with internal resources as part of the NaaS organization)
                        and outsourcing (i.e., reaching out to a third party to take control of
                        operations), both of which will be covered in more detail in the next
                        paragraphs.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">An optional third alternative
                        will also be presented, in which the NaaS operator may choose to outsource some
                        tasks while retaining the majority of their operations. This option will also
                        be covered after reviewing the first couple of models.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Regardless of the model to be
                        chosen, there are several key aspects that the NaaS operator will have to bear
                        in mind for the NOC implementation:</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">All these aspects have been
                        outlined in this document in the previous sections, and the operator will have
                        to define the implementation strategy that best fits their organization taking
                        all these factors into consideration.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">A closer examination of the implementation
                        alternatives is presented below:</p>
                        
                        <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
                            <li><b>Insourced Model</b><br>The insourced model consists of the NaaS operator
                            establishing their own NOC, taking full control of all operation and
                            maintenance activities and functions for their network. An own consolidated and
                            centralized hub for network control can transform the NOC into an engine for
                            revenue growth and an area for competitive differentiation for an operator.<br>
                            In the insourced model, the NaaS operator sets all the
                            structure, functions, processes and tools that will be incorporated into their NOC
                            solution. All documentation, planning and reporting will be tackled by the
                            organization as well.<br>
                            Insourcing implies that all NOC staff will be evaluated,
                            selected, and onboarded by the NaaS operator, starting with the management team
                            all the way down to the engineers performing each function at the NOC. This
                            also means that the Naas operator will have to cope and plan for attrition as
                            well as to plan and schedule for training needs (for network architecture,
                            network technology and governing processes).</li>
                            
                            <li><b>Outsourced Model</b><br>
                            For the outsourced model, the NaaS operator brings a third
                            party to perform all associated activities related to the operation &amp;
                            maintenance of the network. Looking for a NOC service provider means that the
                            operator will need to find a company that has the capability to monitor their
                            network environment. All the aspects that were mentioned in the previous section will now fall into the NOC providers
                            hands.<br>Outsourcing offers relief from the staffing and skills
                            dilemma, allowing organizations to attain almost instant network expertise for
                            maximizing network performance.<br>When an operator chooses to outsource their NOC, along the
                            contracts and agreements made between both companies, the operator can set the
                            requirements for all aspects of the operation, such as the structure to be
                            followed, the functions and processes to be put in place and a recommendation
                            for the tools to be incorporated as part of the providers solution.<br>
                            Some of the questions that the NaaS Operator should make to
                            the potential partners are:<br>
                        
                            <ol class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in;font-size: 16px;' start=1 type='a'>
                                <li class="normal-text">What is the location of their NOC?
                                Potential considerations include communication/language/cultural difficulties,
                                service lag times, outage response times that accompany hiring off-shore or
                                near-shore providers.</li>

                                <li class="normal-text">Can they scale to support the NaaS operator
                                business? Major advantages of outsourcing include flexibility and scalability
                                and these capabilities should be considered from the start.</li>
                        
                                <li class="normal-text">Is their staff on-call or on-site? What
                                type of coverage solutions do they offer? If the NaaS operator decides to
                                outsource network monitoring for full 24x7 coverage, they have to realize some
                                providers support their customers via an on-call rotation, which may not suit
                                the response times needed.</li>
                        
                                <li class="normal-text">How will their NOC access NaaS operators
                                network? Seek for high-availability redundancy options as monitoring is crucial
                                and the NaaS operator cannot afford to have gaps in coverage due to unforeseen
                                circumstances.</li>
                                
                                <li class="normal-text">Is their platform flexible and
                                customizable, or restricted to out-of-the-box functionality? The systems should

                        <p class="normal-text">The insourced model offers full
                        control of the operations to the NaaS Operator, allowing for changes in
                        process/functions to be completed according to the business needs as soon as
                        possible. Compared to the costs associated with the outsourcing model, the insourced
                        model offers a way to drive down costs as needed.</p>

                        difficulties for the NaaS operator as all hiring and training must be performed
                        by them. Because of this, the insourced model is recommended for mature
                        organizations with good human resources practices in place and confidence in
                        the tools/processes to be implemented or for NaaS operators with small networks
                        and tight budget constraints.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The outsourced model is often a
                        costly option, still it offers several benefits as the NaaS operator is
                        liberated from all the HR burden, including training and retaining highly
                        skilled professionals, as well as tool selection and implementation. This is
                        often one of the most difficult scenarios, especially at the beginning of
                        operations, as NOC engineers have to learn at first a networks architecture
                        and technology, the entire range of processes built around the NOC, and tool
                        utilization.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">A NaaS operator should select the
                        outsourced model if the costs associated with outsourcing outweigh the costs
                        associated to having an operation that is not working properly or that is not
                        mature enough.</p>

                        network experiencing difficulties to hire personnel with the right skills and
                        knowledge for such challenge, as the third party can assist the operator

                        <p class="normal-text">The collaborative strategy for
                        the NaaS operator and their customer MNOs begins with the cooperation on the event
                        management process. In this process, any alert or notification raised by any
                        service, resource or monitoring tool is reported in the form of TTs. These TTs
                        are analyzed and solved or escalated by tier 1 NOC in later steps. Ticketing is
                        the most crucial activity since it represents the main input that drives all
                        the NOC activities.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The next task in the NOC overall
                        process is the fault management on any anomaly reported by event management. In
                        this phase, the communication is vital: the faster, the better. An earlier and
                        clearer exchange of information between involved parties would lead to a
                        quicker resolution. The tier 2 and tier 3 support following the fault management
                        stage can be on the NaaS or MNO side (depending on the NOC implementation
                        model).</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The other two processes for which
                        a lower degree of integration of systems is required are performance management
                        and billing &amp; revenue reconciliation. The first refers to the constant
                        monitoring of the network looking for poor performance of the network or opportunity
                        areas where to increase the performance. The integration of performance systems
                        can lead to a better understanding of the network and cooperative measures or
                        changes can be implemented more effectively.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The last process is the billing
                        and revenue reconciliation. This stage is key towards a successful business
                        partnership between the NaaS operator and their customer MNOs. The purpose of
                        this task is to reach agreements on the periodic billing or revenue amounts
                        based on the associated costs and profits of the network operation. Again,
                        communication is the key to avoid misunderstandings and to efficient the
                        overall process.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">There are two generic modes for
                        all the integration of the communication conduits mentioned above: the manual
                        and the automated. The first is characterized by a minimum or non-existent
                        integration of the involved systems and relying on basic and slow human
                        one-to-one or one-to-many communication. The automated mode targets for almost
                        full integration of the systems. The intercommunication of these systems is based
                        on automatic request and replies which lead to a near-real-time interaction.</p>

                        Ticketing</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">As previously stated, ticketing
                        is one of the pillars for NOC activities, so it is a mandatory item in the
                        collaboration strategy. The purpose of this system integration is the fast and
                        clear exchange of information for any irregularity in the network or the
                        service. For any NaaS operator, this is mandatory for a healthy relationship
                        with their customer MNOs.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">There are several advantages when
                        implementing an efficient ticketing process: reduction in the response times
                        when an abnormality in the services/network occurs and decreasing of the
                        overhead for the MNOs when opening a ticket. The disadvantage would be that the
                        integration of systems can be hard to achieve when the already implemented
                        tools do not allow this option.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">This scheme avoids the system
                        integration with ticketing from tenant NOCs. The tenant NOCs may have
                        independent tools from NaaS operator, and no special feature or interface is
                        needed. The collaboration is via phone calls or formal emails. When an email or
                        phone call takes place to open a TT, the NaaS Operator NOC personnel must
                        manually insert the details into their SDM/ticketing system. This method could
                        lead to errors in capturing the details of the problem besides the long times
                        for reporting.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">The SDM/ticketing systems are
                        interconnected so the TT can be raised directly by the customer MNO and the
                        NaaS operator NOC can initiate the process towards the solution. After the
                        resolution of the problem, the NOC can close the created ticket and the tenant
                        NOCs are informed of the outcome almost instantly. An example of this system is
                        a web- or cloud-based ticketing.</p>

                        Fault Management</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Fault management is the second
                        pillar of NOC functionality and mandatory in the collaborative strategy. The
                        system integration objective is to reduce the necessary time for problem
                        solving and escalation time towards the compliance of pre-agreed SLAs.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The advantages and disadvantages
                        are quite like the ones of ticketing due to the closeness of these two
                        processes. It reduces the time for problem-solving since it offers alarms and
                        diagnostic elements almost instantaneously. Furthermore, it enables the
                        operator to have a shared source of truth and optimizes the overall process by
                        eliminating points of human failure. On the other side, although the
                        integration of FM systems is more feasible (compared to the ticketing), it is
                        not always possible due to lack of compatible interfaces. It is required that
                        the interfaces for interconnection are compatible from system to system.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text"><b>Manual Mode</b></p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">In the manual mode, the fault management
                        systems are not interconnected and the exchange of information such as alarms
                        of network/service is done by sharing a compendium of alarms files if the tool
                        allows it. These files can be shared by email or any other formal channel.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text"><b>Automated Mode</b></p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">When the systems are
                        interconnected and the alarms &amp; notifications are delivered automatically
                        between the fault management tools, the information of the alarm is not
                        modified, and the integrity is preserved. The update of the notification is in
                        real-time and the analysis of the issue is done with no delays. The fault management
                        tool uses a request/response paradigm to communicate through standardized
                        interfaces (e.g., SNMP traps, API exposure, NETCONF protocol based). Examples
                        of these are umbrella tools and the interconnection of EMS/OSS systems.</p>

                        Performance Monitoring</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Performance Monitoring has less
                        criticality since it is an extended function of the NOC and can be considered
                        as optional. Here, the purpose of the integration is to draw more attention on
                        the performance KPIs so its easier to find areas of opportunity for
                        enhancements of the network.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The advantages are that more
                        people can analyze the performance KPIs and it is more likely to find a root
                        problem or any improvement in the usage of the network. The disadvantage would
                        be that the integration is more challenging to achieve than the previous systems
                        since, in this case, the access should permit MNOs to only access their own
                        KPIs. If access is not properly controlled, a privacy issue may be raised. In
                        this case, the access management is more challenging since the permissions have
                        more precise delimitations.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">When implementing a manual mode,
                        the exposure of the KPIs may be done through periodic reports or presentations.
                        Since it is not a mandatory requirement, these reports may not always be shared
                        and should be requested via formal email or phone call. This process would
                        require a certain degree of organization between the NaaS operator and the
                        involved MNO. It also needs more human effort into generating these
                        reports/presentations according to the total number of MNOs.</p>

                        into the KPIs that are relevant to it. The coordination between tools should be
                        more precise, but the results are the monitoring of the network performance in

                        Billing and Revenue Reconciliation</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">On the business side, the
                        collaboration strategy contemplates the reconciliation of billing and, when it
                        applies, revenue. The purpose of the integration of this system is to assure
                        the data integrity and provide clarity of the billing and revenue. This must be
                        considered mandatory to the collaborative strategy since the heart of the
                        relationship between the NaaS operator and their customer MNO is
                        business-based.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The pros of having these systems
                        integrated are that the data used for billing and revenue clarifications is
                        unmodified as a unified source of truth. Moreover, continuous monitoring can
                        lead to better business estimations without the need of waiting for the
                        periodic reports. The con is that data must be selected before shared with MNOs
                        to avoid any information leak to other MNOs. This would also involve the
                        overseeing of access to the systems involved.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">In this mode, the billing and revenue
                        reconciliation is done by periodic meetings with business areas from a specific
                        MNO. The MNO and the NaaS operator need to have implemented independent tools
                        to have a formal discussion if the processed billing data differ. In this
                        scheme, the human effort is increased by the number of MNO, since a customized
                        report and an isolated meeting should be carried out per MNO.</p>

                        integration of the billing systems at BSS level. The information is
                        pre-processed only to select the pertinent information to be shared per MNO. A
                        formal meeting is always a good practice when billing data differs. Here, the
                        BSS has more standardized interfaces towards other BSS, so the integrations are
                        easier.</p>

                        efficient way of enabling the NaaS operator to avoid the human point of error
                        when issuing a TT; besides, it allows the NaaS operator for easy management of
                        the TT. The FM is considered key to a combined work, so the systems are fully interconnected,
                        and this interconnection makes the problem solving smoother. Since the performance
                        management is optional, a standard periodic reporting is enough. Finally, the
                        decision of billing/revenue reconciliation integration allows the NaaS operator
                        to have a better relationship with their customer MNOs.</p>

                        resources will be presented, starting with the tier 1 and tier 2 teams as shown

                        the operators and the management team calculation, as shown in Figure 15:</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">It is important to note that the
                        additional staff resources due to number of MNOs will not greatly impact on the
                        overall quantity. An additional 10% per MNO should suffice to cope with the
                        demands of the MNOs.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Finally, it is worth mentioning
                        that the tool is provided in Excel format which enables the NaaS Operator to
                        change the underlying dimensioning assumptions based on their own experience or
                        estimates.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">To dimension the NOC facility the
                        NaaS operator must consider the peak number of resources that will be working

                        section.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Through facility sizing the NaaS operator
                        will be able to estimate office space, office equipment and networking and

                        of meeting/situation rooms needed, number of restrooms, laptops, screens,

                        <p class="normal-text">Regarding the office space, it is
                        important to consider that access and security infrastructure will be needed, as
                        well as proper electrical/power distribution to be analyzed to offer a high
