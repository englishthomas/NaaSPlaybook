                        <p class="normal-text">The Field                        Technician activities function is the most vital function that is supported by                        the Field Force organization. Field Techs take over site assistance on sites,                        commonly for 24 hours a day and 365 days a year (although other arrangements do                        exist, as 8x5, 16x5, etc.), performing tasks to resolve faults on-site or                        assist with on-hands support in troubleshooting efforts along with the Network                        Operation Center's Tier 1 or Tier 2 engineers. The most common setup is to have                        a Field Technician crew consisting of at least two field techs working on a                        site at any given time; this is to facilitate work at height and for health                        &amp; safety concerns in remote areas. However, the NaaS Operator may consider                        to have only one technician on site for simple preventive maintenance tasks                        that do not require work at height. <b>From this point forward, every time a                        Field Technician is mentioned on this document it is translated to a Field                        Technician crew.</b> </p>

                        <p class="normal-text">One of the most                        common aggregation of functions is performed by embedding the Field                        Coordinator/Dispatcher function into the Network Operation Center Tier 1 level                        functions. This translates into aggregating the Access Management and Field                        Dispatch functions into the NOC Tier 1 team. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This can prove                        effective when the NOC is monitoring a small network comprised of less than 250                        sites (or if network monitoring is broken up into different regions, each one                        covered by a small team of engineers). In this scenario, the Tier 1 team will                        also be in charge of executing field dispatches (if necessary) and making the necessary                        adjustments to make sure that there will be access to the site for the Field                        Technicians. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">As mentioned                        before, this option is best suited for region-based monitoring or for small                        networks, as the increase in functions makes them aware of all details for                        their respective sites, but in turn, the overhead associated with this setup                        may challenge the NOC Tier 1 team. The alternative configuration is to have a                        separate Field Manager or Field Dispatcher performing this function.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">Preventive Maintenance refers to scheduled, periodic maintenance of                        equipment to prevent unexpected breakdowns. This includes but is not restricted                        to tests, measurements and coordinated part replacements.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Preventive Maintenance is implemented through a schedule of planned                        maintenance with the aim of preventing breakdowns and failures. Preventive                        Maintenance can be a periodic activity, but it may also be a one-time activity.                        It can take the form of physical checks or logical activities like system                        backups. It ensures consumables such as equipment spares, are readily available                        should they be needed. Preventive Maintenance is not limited to physical                        checks, it should include regular system backups with offsite storage and                        checks for known errors as reported by the equipment vendors.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">The primary goal of Preventive Maintenance is to avoid or mitigate                        equipment failures, and thereby reduce the cost that comes with corrective                        actions. This in turn will increase customer satisfaction. With Preventive                        Maintenance, it is ensured that all equipment is regularly checked and is ready                        for service when required.</p>

                            <li>The main input into this process is the                            reception of a preventive maintenance request. The Field Manager reviews the                            Preventive Maintenance Request.</li>
                            
                            <li>The Field Manager creates or updates a                            Preventive Maintenance Plan. </li>
                            
                            <li>The Field Manager engages with Operation and                            Maintenance for validation and approval of the Maintenance Plan. Typically, the                            Maintenance organization will validate and approve the plan and the Operations                            organization (represented by the Network Operation Center's NOC Manager or the                            Change Manager) will be consulted and advised of the corresponding plan.</li>
                            
                            <li>Once O&amp;M approves the plan, the Field                            Manager creates a Preventive Maintenance Ticket. At this point, it must be                            determined whether the activity is service impacting.</li>
                            
                            <li>If the maintenance activity impacts service,                            then this should go through the Change Management process, which is fully                            reviewed in section 4.1.4 of the <a href="noc.html" class="a_link">Network                            Operation Center module</a>.</li>

                            <li>The Field Technician reviews the ticket and                            ensures that he understands the list of activities to be performed. In case of                            assistance from an external contractor is needed, the Field Technician                            guarantees such assistance will be provided on-site for the scheduled activity.</li>
                            
                            <li>Before proceeding with the execution, the Field                            Technician will coordinate with the Network Operation Center team to ensure                            that the network is in good condition and that there are no conflicting                            activities, such as a change or incident. </li>
                            
                            <li>Once the network condition is confirmed, the                            Field Technician will then proceed to execute the Preventive Maintenance                            activities.</li>
                            
                            <li>'After activity completion, the Field Technician                            creates a Preventive Maintenance Report, which is forwarded to the Field                            Manager. </li>
                            
                            <li>The Field Technician then updates the ticket and                            closes the Preventive Maintenance ticket.</li>

Although                        feasible, this option is not recommended as this would translate into an                        absence of spare parts availability on a centralized, secure location.                        Alternatives are to have the Field Technicians stocking spare parts on their                        own which is not a secure option, or requesting parts directly with the vendor                        each time a spare part is needed, taking into consideration the time overhead                        this alternative implies.</p>

This may become an                        alternative if the operator does not see fit to have a maintenance plan for the                        network, focusing on corrective interventions alone at least for the initial                        stages of the organization, or if the Field Technician team is comprised of a                        very few members and the operator does not want to have preventive maintenance                        activities occupying resources that could be focusing on corrective interventions.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">There are three tools commonly used by a                        Field Maintenance organization to achieve its objectives. These are the Service                        Desk Management tool (which is also used by the Network Operation Center and                        the Service Operation Center organizations), a Dispatch Tool and a Network                        Inventory Management System (NIMS). </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The Dispatch Tool can be regarded as the mandatory tool for the                        Field Maintenance team. While the SDM tool is a mandatory tool for the NOC and                        SOC, it can be viewed as an optional tool for the Field Maintenance team, as                        well as the NIMS tool. An overview of these tools is presented in the following                        sections.</p>
                        
                        <h3>5.1.1                        Service Desk Management Tool</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This tool is used for the documentation of all incidents, problems                        and changes that are being worked on the network at any given time. It can be                        considered one of the main tools used by the NOC and the SOC teams, as it                        enables the teams on both organizations to have a proper mechanism to document                        all activities surrounding each incident, problem or change ticket, including                        field interventions performed by the Field Maintenance Team.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">A proper tool for documentation aids the team as they can know                        exactly what the status of any ticket is, what are the next items to be solved                        and what needs to be followed-up. It also enables reporting, which serves as                        the basis for Governance activities: revision of the Field Maintenance                        performance, KPIs, SLAs, etc.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">A full Service Desk Management tool is a very powerful tool that                        incorporates modules for Incident Management (Incident tickets), Problem                        Management (Problem tickets) and Change Management (Change tickets). It also                        includes a Knowledge Base module (KB Articles) that serves as a repository for                        all the KB information used by all NOC, SOC and Field Maintenance teams,                        updated with key past experiences and lessons learned for future reference and                        improvements.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">As discussed in section 5.1.1 of the Network Operation Center                        Module, another alternative to consider is to have a Ticketing tool instead of                        an SDM tool, if the focus will be set on fault restoral and less on Problem or                        Change Management. This option can be taken by the operator regardless of                        having a NOC/SOC/Field Maintenance structure in place as all three                        organizations could benefit from the SDM tool but other alternatives are available                        as well. This will be further discussed in section 5.2.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">The Network Inventory Management System (usually known as NIMS) is a                        tool that aids the Field Maintenance organization to manage all the assets on                        the network. This enables the field area manager or the field                        coordinator/dispatcher to have records of all the equipment that is installed                        within the network, and have up-to-date the information accordingly with the                        changes or replacements that are executed by the Field Maintenance team. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The NIMS tool allows for a precise view of inventory status at any                        given time and ensures better control of the network assets. It is a useful                        tool that aids the field maintenance management team to know when to acquire                        new assets/spare parts or to decommission old ones, which can help with general                        network performance and uptime, along with capacity planning. This tool helps                        to keep track of equipment in a more efficient manner.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Examples of commercial tools are Ericsson Adaptive Inventory, Amdocs                        Cramer, Nokia Inventory Data Manager or Oracle Unified Inventory Management.                        Currently, there are no known open source or free tools that offer the same                        level of information and features as the commercially available NIMS tools, but                        the NaaS operator could explore available options such as Kuwaiba or Odoo                        Inventory to review if they can be adapted for their organization. </p>

After the NOC has determined that assistance                        from a field tech is needed, they can note their ticket and call the actual                        Field Technician directly to let them know that they need to dispatch to a                        site.<br>This of course leaves out                        most of the benefits this tool can bring to the organization, such as:<br>                                                <ol class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in;font-size: 15px;' start=1 type=1>                            <li class="normal-text">Automatic assignment of field crews</li>

                        <br>Since all transactions
                        would be executed manually and followed-up by phone calls between the agents
                        involved in the work order (Field Technician, dispatcher/coordinator and the
                        NOC), SLA/KPI analysis, which are part of the management tasks become more
                        difficult as most of the tracking is performed manually, which requires review
                        of every ticket's note to get the information that is needed for reporting.</li>

                        <p class="normal-text">The NaaS operator can                        consider that there are free SDM tools available in the market, and some of                        them have open trials. By taking advantage of this, the Field Maintenance team                        could explore the tool to assess if its use is beneficial for their                        organization.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">A Network Inventory Management System can bring value to an                        organization that handles a highly distributed spare part system or for an                        organization that handles several levels of warehouses (local, regional,                        centralized). It can also be beneficial for a NaaS operator that will keep in                        control not only the physical assets of the network, but also the software and                        configurations that are present for each element in the network.</p>

An optional third alternative is also available, in which                        the NaaS operator may choose to outsource some tasks (such as the Field                        Intervention function) while retaining the other part of the operation (such as                        the leadership function, referred to as the Dispatcher &amp; Coordination                        function).</p>

As such, the first thing                        that needs to be defined by the NaaS operator is the criticality matrix. Please                        refer to the <a href="noc.html" class="a_link">Network                        Operation Center module</a> for a complete                        discussion on the NOC's service level settings. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">After the criticality matrix is set, the NaaS Operator must set two                        variables for each category:</p>
                        
                        <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>

                        <p class="normal-text">The first                        variable is strictly Field Maintenance dependent and is usually expressed in                        minutes (X minutes from dispatch creation to dispatch acknowledge and field                        tech assignment).</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The second                        variable needs consideration of several factors, including average travel time,                        spare part pick-up, and the agreed contractual SLAs for new parts that may be                        required and that are not existent in the warehouse.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">It is important                        to note that the SLA for the Field Maintenance Team will be closely related to                        the NOC SLA and NOC Response + Analysis time. For example, if the NOC SLA is 8                        hours, the NOC response time is 15 minutes, and the NOC analysis time is 30                        minutes, then the Field Maintenance SLA will be 7 hours 45 minutes.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">Then a complete                        list of all the resources will be presented, including the Field Technicians,                        the Dispatch/Coordinator position and the Field Manager position as shown in                        Figure 11:</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">As seen in                        Figure 11, there are two columns named Proposed Value and Custom Value.                        Proposed Value is a flag set to indicate that the specific role is going to be                        considered as part of the team configuration. It is automatically populated                        based on the selected configuration.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">In a similar                        vein, the Custom Value flag should be edited by the user when selecting the                        option for custom configuration (See Figure 10). Rows with value 'Yes' will be                        populated with the total number of staff resources, rows with value 'No' will                        be left empty.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Finally, it is                        worth mentioning that the tool is provided in Excel format which enables the                        NaaS Operator to change the underlying dimensioning assumptions based on their                        own experience or estimates.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">For the                        facilities, the operator needs to consider the peak number of resources that                        could be working on the Field Maintenance premises, according to the                        dimensioning performed on the previous section. The most common environment is                        to have Field Technicians working and reporting from their own houses, while                        the Field Manager or the Dispatcher are working on a centralized area or in the                        Network Operation Center facility.</p>

The                        office equipment needs to be considered as well (laptops, screens, desks,                        chairs), and also routing and switching equipment/ports need to be calculated.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">If the NaaS                        Operator does not consider that the Field Force team need a facility of their                        own, then adjustments for the Field Manager or the Dispatcher/Coordinator team                        should be included in the Network Operation Center facility design and sizing.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">In any case, the NaaS Operator should keep in mind that the Field                        Technicians will have to be equipped with several tools needed for their                        day-to-day work, such as Screwdrivers, Hammers, Cutters, Crimping Tools, Knife,                        Drilling Machine, Punching Tools, RF Cable Cutter, Multimeter, Digital Power                        Meter, Ethernet Tester or a VSWR Meter.

Field Techs take over site assistance on sites,                        commonly for 24 hours a day and 365 days a year (although other arrangements do                        exist, as 8x5, 16x5, etc.), performing tasks to resolve faults on-site or                        assist with on-hands support in troubleshooting efforts along with the Network                        Operation Center's Tier 1 or Tier 2 engineers. The most common setup is to have                        a Field Technician crew consisting of at least two field techs working on a                        site at any given time; this is to facilitate work at height and for health                        &amp; safety concerns in remote areas. However, the NaaS Operator may consider                        to have only one technician on site for simple preventive maintenance tasks                        that do not require work at height. <b>From this point forward, every time a                        Field Technician is mentioned on this document it is translated to a Field                        Technician crew.</b> </p>

                        <p class="normal-text">One of the most                        common aggregation of functions is performed by embedding the Field                        Coordinator/Dispatcher function into the Network Operation Center Tier 1 level                        functions. This translates into aggregating the Access Management and Field                        Dispatch functions into the NOC Tier 1 team. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This can prove                        effective when the NOC is monitoring a small network comprised of less than 250                        sites (or if network monitoring is broken up into different regions, each one                        covered by a small team of engineers). In this scenario, the Tier 1 team will                        also be in charge of executing field dispatches (if necessary) and making the necessary                        adjustments to make sure that there will be access to the site for the Field                        Technicians. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">As mentioned                        before, this option is best suited for region-based monitoring or for small                        networks, as the increase in functions makes them aware of all details for                        their respective sites, but in turn, the overhead associated with this setup                        may challenge the NOC Tier 1 team. The alternative configuration is to have a                        separate Field Manager or Field Dispatcher performing this function.</p>

The Field Force main                        POC is typically the Field or Area manager (or the Dispatch &amp; Coordination                        team in absence of the former) who is usually in charge of all the Field Force                        structure, including the Dispatch &amp; Coordination function and the Field                        Technician teams (who undertake the Field Technician activities function). The                        entire team is supervised by a NOC/SOC Head, who acts as the ultimate                        responsible for the NOC, SOC and Field Maintenance operations.</p>

Field Coordinators usually respond to the acting                        Incident Manager on duty, who is the highest-ranking officer for any operative                        decision.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">Preventive Maintenance refers to scheduled, periodic maintenance of                        equipment to prevent unexpected breakdowns. This includes but is not restricted                        to tests, measurements and coordinated part replacements.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Preventive Maintenance is implemented through a schedule of planned                        maintenance with the aim of preventing breakdowns and failures. Preventive                        Maintenance can be a periodic activity, but it may also be a one-time activity.                        It can take the form of physical checks or logical activities like system                        backups. It ensures consumables such as equipment spares, are readily available                        should they be needed. Preventive Maintenance is not limited to physical                        checks, it should include regular system backups with offsite storage and                        checks for known errors as reported by the equipment vendors.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">A Preventive Maintenance plan describes a list of activities to be                        performed on equipment according to a schedule - for example: daily, weekly,                        fortnightly, monthly, quarterly, and annually.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The primary goal of Preventive Maintenance is to avoid or mitigate                        equipment failures, and thereby reduce the cost that comes with corrective                        actions. This in turn will increase customer satisfaction. With Preventive                        Maintenance, it is ensured that all equipment is regularly checked and is ready                        for service when required.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">Field                        Intervention is a mandatory process for the Field Force operation, as it is the                        main process followed by the Field Maintenance organization to troubleshoot and                        fix failures that are present on any site. Without such process in place,                        hardware failures would not be resolved, and service could be interrupted for                        the end-user, damaging the reputation of the NaaS operator.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">There are two                        process adjustments that may be considered by the NaaS operator:</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">One option that may be considered by the NaaS                        operator is to remove the Warehouse from the Spare Parts process. Although                        feasible, this option is not recommended as this would translate into an                        absence of spare parts availability on a centralized, secure location.                        Alternatives are to have the Field Technicians stocking spare parts on their                        own which is not a secure option, or requesting parts directly with the vendor                        each time a spare part is needed, taking into consideration the time overhead                        this alternative implies.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">Another option that could be considered by the                        NaaS operator is eliminate the Preventive Maintenance process from the core                        processes executed by the field maintenance organization. This may become an                        alternative if the operator does not see fit to have a maintenance plan for the                        network, focusing on corrective interventions alone at least for the initial                        stages of the organization, or if the Field Technician team is comprised of a                        very few members and the operator does not want to have preventive maintenance                        activities occupying resources that could be focusing on corrective interventions.</p>

                        <br><h2><a class="titulo-h2 anchor-bum color-luminati-3" name="item5-1">5.1                        Tools High-Level View</a></h2>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">There are three tools commonly used by a                        Field Maintenance organization to achieve its objectives. These are the Service                        Desk Management tool (which is also used by the Network Operation Center and                        the Service Operation Center organizations), a Dispatch Tool and a Network                        Inventory Management System (NIMS). </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The Dispatch Tool can be regarded as the mandatory tool for the                        Field Maintenance team. While the SDM tool is a mandatory tool for the NOC and                        SOC, it can be viewed as an optional tool for the Field Maintenance team, as                        well as the NIMS tool. An overview of these tools is presented in the following                        sections.</p>
                        
                        <h3>5.1.1                        Service Desk Management Tool</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">This tool is used for the documentation of all incidents, problems                        and changes that are being worked on the network at any given time. It can be                        considered one of the main tools used by the NOC and the SOC teams, as it                        enables the teams on both organizations to have a proper mechanism to document                        all activities surrounding each incident, problem or change ticket, including                        field interventions performed by the Field Maintenance Team.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">A proper tool for documentation aids the team as they can know                        exactly what the status of any ticket is, what are the next items to be solved                        and what needs to be followed-up. It also enables reporting, which serves as                        the basis for Governance activities: revision of the Field Maintenance                        performance, KPIs, SLAs, etc.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">A full Service Desk Management tool is a very powerful tool that                        incorporates modules for Incident Management (Incident tickets), Problem                        Management (Problem tickets) and Change Management (Change tickets). It also                        includes a Knowledge Base module (KB Articles) that serves as a repository for                        all the KB information used by all NOC, SOC and Field Maintenance teams,                        updated with key past experiences and lessons learned for future reference and                        improvements.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">As discussed in section 5.1.1 of the Network Operation Center                        Module, another alternative to consider is to have a Ticketing tool instead of                        an SDM tool, if the focus will be set on fault restoral and less on Problem or                        Change Management. This option can be taken by the operator regardless of                        having a NOC/SOC/Field Maintenance structure in place as all three                        organizations could benefit from the SDM tool but other alternatives are available                        as well. This will be further discussed in section 5.2.</p>

The NaaS Operator could also look for other available tools that are not fully                        telecom-oriented, but that could be adapted for their organization since they                        offer some of the features already covered. Finally, some free or open-source                        tools could work as alternatives for budget-constraint organizations.</p>

                        <h3>5.1.3                        Network Inventory Management System</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The Network Inventory Management System (usually known as NIMS) is a                        tool that aids the Field Maintenance organization to manage all the assets on                        the network. This enables the field area manager or the field                        coordinator/dispatcher to have records of all the equipment that is installed                        within the network, and have up-to-date the information accordingly with the                        changes or replacements that are executed by the Field Maintenance team. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The NIMS tool allows for a precise view of inventory status at any                        given time and ensures better control of the network assets. It is a useful                        tool that aids the field maintenance management team to know when to acquire                        new assets/spare parts or to decommission old ones, which can help with general                        network performance and uptime, along with capacity planning. This tool helps                        to keep track of equipment in a more efficient manner.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Examples of commercial tools are Ericsson Adaptive Inventory, Amdocs                        Cramer, Nokia Inventory Data Manager or Oracle Unified Inventory Management.                        Currently, there are no known open source or free tools that offer the same                        level of information and features as the commercially available NIMS tools, but                        the NaaS operator could explore available options such as Kuwaiba or Odoo                        Inventory to review if they can be adapted for their organization. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Commercial and open-source tools are listed in Table 3. It is                        important to note that open source or free tools may not have the same level of                        information and features of commercial tools, but maybe enough for the NaaS Organization                        needs.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">There is a tool that can be considered as critical and needs to be                        part of the Field Maintenance solution incorporated by the NaaS operator:</p>

After the NOC has determined that assistance                        from a field tech is needed, they can note their ticket and call the actual                        Field Technician directly to let them know that they need to dispatch to a                        site.<br>This of course leaves out                        most of the benefits this tool can bring to the organization, such as:<br>                                                <ol class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in;font-size: 15px;' start=1 type=1>                            <li class="normal-text">Automatic assignment of field crews</li>

                        would be executed manually and followed-up by phone calls between the agents
                        involved in the work order (Field Technician, dispatcher/coordinator and the
                        NOC), SLA/KPI analysis, which are part of the management tasks become more
                        difficult as most of the tracking is performed manually, which requires review
                        of every ticket's note to get the information that is needed for reporting.</li>

If the Dispatch tool is in place in the                        organization, another benefit that usually spans from its use is that updates                        executed by the Field Technician are automatically synced in the ticket                        directly (whereas it's an incident, change or problem ticket). </p>

By taking advantage of this, the Field Maintenance team                        could explore the tool to assess if its use is beneficial for their                        organization.</p>

It can also be beneficial for a NaaS operator that will keep in                        control not only the physical assets of the network, but also the software and                        configurations that are present for each element in the network.</p>
