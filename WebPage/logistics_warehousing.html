                        it can be seen that the major requirement for space is during the deployment
                        phase. After the deployment phase is completed, lower space requirements are
                        needed to maintain the spare parts. Therefore, an estimation of the space
                        requirements considering the necessities during the deployment phase can be
                        performed to define the High-Level L&amp;W Dimensioning. </p>

                        to estimate the number of warehouse facilities to store the Inventory during
                        the deployment phase. In this process, Materials Forecast is performed to
                        estimate the required material volumes to support the Deployment Plan. Then,
                        the space to keep the materials stored is calculated, considering the schedule
                        within the Deployment Plan. The space requirement is calculated based on the
                        number of sites to be deployed and the equipment dimensions that conform each
                        Site Bundle (see section 4.1.1.3 for more details). Finally, the number and
                        type of warehouses is obtained by mapping the space requirements into standard

                        <p class="normal-text">NaaS operators
                        must define a strategy that guides the decisions related to Logistics &amp;
                        Warehousing activities. The possible alternatives to implement these services
                        are described in the following subsections.</p>
                        
                        <h3>3.2.1
                        Self-Managed Services</h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">One alternative
                        to perform the Logistics and Warehousing services is that the NaaS Operator
                        implements them with their own resources at their own facilities. This option
                        is only applicable if the NaaS operator already has an existing implementation
                        of these services or if they possess enough resources to implement them.
                        Another case that fits this strategy is for small NaaS Operators with no more
                        than a handful of sites as little space to store equipment is required.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The
                        implementation of this option provides greater control over the L&amp;W
                        operations and allows a better integration with other areas of the NaaS
                        organization. For instance, the Warehouse can be tailored to the NaaS
                        operators needs, in the right location, right size and can accommodate
                        supplementary activities (e.g. Kitting). Moreover, the integration of multiple
                        systems throughout NaaS operators, facilitates de communication among the
                        areas. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">However, this
                        option also presents some drawbacks. Firstly, it requires an additional design
                        phase if the Logistics &amp; Warehousing services are not already deployed.
                        Furthermore, it may represent additional costs such as Warehouse Facilities operational
                        expenses (e.g. electricity to power equipment), specialized Management Systems
                        and the personnel to run the operations. </p>

                        <p class="normal-text">Another option
                        for the NaaS operator consists of hiring a Third-party Logistics and
                        Warehousing Company to manage these services. Typically, the NaaS operator
                        specifies the standards and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that the service
                        provider must meet. In this way, the operations of these services are the
                        responsibility of the third-party, lightening the operational workload of the
                        NaaS operator.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">In addition,
                        this approach is appropriate when the deployment is performed over a wide area
                        or several regions, allowing multiple service providers to be hired according
                        to the geographical region. Finally, this approach is adequate to fulfill the
                        L&amp;W requirements in a very short period of time as services are
                        ready-to-use and no design phase must be performed. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The benefits of
                        this implementation option have to be balanced against the loss of control in
                        the operations side. Furthermore, the cost of the operational services tend to
                        be higher than Self-Managed services </p>

                        and then scale to Third-Party Managed Services as needed, as illustrated in

                        can apply this hybrid approach during the intensive deployment phase by using

                        Services cannot satisfy. When the intensive deployment phase is completed, the
                        burden of these services will decrease so it can be covered by Self-Managed
                        Services. In this case, the space requirement will be driven by the spare
                        equipment. </p>

                        Self-Managed Services have higher fixed costs but lower unit operating costs.
                        In contrast, Third-party Managed Services have low fixed costs but potentially

                        location definition involves a hierarchy of decisions. The first of them is to

                        geographic conditions of the region and the availability of potential
                        facilities. Figure 8 displays an example of the calculation of the Center of

                        based on the location of the RAN sites, is selected for the following reasons:
                        Firstly, during the intensive deployment phase, having the Warehouse uniformly
                        away from all the RAN sites, maintains steady the Outbound Transportation
                        costs, as in average, all the transportation costs are similar. Furthermore,
                        after the deployment phase is completed, the spare equipment will be kept
                        stored in Warehouse facilities. A Warehouse location relatively close to all
                        the RAN sites reduces the Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) times, improving the

                            when selecting the right location of a Warehouse. In addition, special
                            attention must be paid to local governmental regulations, tax structure and tax
                            incentives. </li>

                        between NaaS operator Warehouse and the final RAN site location. The
                        Transportation Network Design seeks to optimize objectives (e.g., cost of
                        transportation and total travel time) through the selection of appropriate
                        modes of transportation and optimal route planning.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">The mode of
                        transportation describes the type of transport used to move the materials among
                        facilities. There are different options (e.g., rail, road, water and air), each
                        with different characteristics. The most common modes of transportation used by
                        NaaS operators are examined in the following subsections. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text"><b><u>Road
                        Transport</u></b></p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">In the NaaS
                        operator context, road is the most widely mode of transportation. Its main
                        benefit is the flexibility, as it can be used to visit almost any location.
                        Moreover, the ability to provide an end-to-end service avoids transfer to other
                        modes reducing the overall travel time. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Furthermore,
                        vehicles do not have to keep such rigid timetables (compared with trains or
                        airplanes), so they can go on journeys at short notice and with little
                        planning. Nonetheless, travel speed can be an important consideration,
                        especially as roads are becoming more congested and vehicles are particularly
                        vulnerable to congestion and traffic delays.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Finally, it
                        needs to be considered that in rural environments, most of the roads will not
                        be paved and special considerations have to be examined for the transport
                        vehicles. </p>

                        <p class="normal-text">Multi-mode
                        transport involves the combination of two or more different modes of transport.
                        In this way, the benefits of different modes can be combined, avoiding the
                        disadvantages of the others. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Multi-mode
                        transport is particularly relevant for NaaS operators as in most cases in rural
                        areas, combining different modes of transport is the only way to transport the
                        network elements to distant nodes. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The main issue
                        is that each transfer between different modes causes delays and increases the
                        costs of extra handling. Therefore, efficient transfers are vital to implement
                        multi-mode transport, coordinating transport schedules to avoid additional
                        delays. </p>

                            <li><i>Adjust previous plans</i>  A useful approach is to keep records of
                            previous planned routes and update them based on current conditions. This
                            approach has the benefit of being relatively easy to implement and causing
                            little disruption. However, the routes may take a long time to be designed. </li>
                            
                            <li><i>Use of specialized
                            systems </i> There are specialized
                            software in the market that can be used to generate the routes. Most of these
                            tools use proprietary algorithms to generate optimal routes. However, the

                        algorithm and is comprised of the following steps: </p>

                            <li><b>Step 1.</b> Establish a preliminary route that visits all
                            the destinations starting by the Warehouse facility. For this, look for the
                            closest destination and add it to the route. Follow the same approach for the
                            next destination, going only to the closest non-visited destination. Once all
                            the destinations are visited, return to the Warehouse facility. Calculate the
                            total distance of the preliminary route. </li>
                            
                            <li><b>Step 2.</b> Select randomly two locations in the route,
                            swap their positions in the route and calculate the total distance of the
                            route. If the total distance decreases, maintain this route and go to Step 3.
                            If the distance increases, return to the previous route and go to Step 3.</li>
                            
                            <li><b>Step 3. </b>Repeat Step 2 until no significant reduction in

                        <p class="normal-text">The most common management methods implemented in the industry are Material Requirements Planning (MRP) and Just-in-Time (JIT). However, JIT is not entirely suitable to be implemented by NaaS operators as, among other restrictive requirements, it demands minimal lead times, which is hard to obtain for telecommunication equipment, especially in rural environments. Therefore, only MRP is further examined in this section.</p>

It consists of three primary steps: taking inventory of the materials and components available, identifying which additional ones are needed and then scheduling their procurement process.</p>

                        inferred by analyzing the process, MRP avoids the additional costs of keeping a
                        large inventory by relating the supply of materials directly to the demand.
                        Furthermore, MRP can also give early warning of potential problems and
                        shortages. For instance, if the MRP schedule shows that some materials will
                        arrive too late, the NaaS operator can speed up the deliveries or even change
                        the deployment plans. </p>

                        <h3>5.1.2 Inventory Volume Considerations </h3>
                        <p class="normal-text">During the Deployment Phase, NaaS operators must maintain certain inventory stored in stock to enable an efficient network rollout. In order to obtain this material, a Purchase Order (PO) must be issued to equipment vendors, which specifies the purchased material volume. The following considerations must be taken into account regarding the order volumes requested from vendors: </p>
                        
                        <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
                            <li>Once materials arrive at Warehouse, certain activities must be performed to properly classify the inventory (e.g., labelling). The order volume directly impacts the required time to perform these activities.</li>
                            <li>To deploy a new site, the complete bill of materials which includes equipment for different technologies (and/or vendors) and installation ancillaries must be consolidated into a single bundle (e.g. kitting). Warehouse must have the adequate personnel and abilities to comply with these activities. Otherwise, the kitting process can be outsourced to the network equipment vendor.</li>
                            <li>Large material volumes require high average stock levels, which inherently increases the total Holding Costs and the required storage space.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="normal-text">For the reasons above, it is highly recommended to optimally estimate the purchase order volume. The methodologies to perform this estimation are presented in the following section.</p>
                        <p class="normal-text">In case that a significant volume of material is required to comply with the deployment plan, NaaS operator must take the following general considerations: </p>

                        <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
                            <li>A qualified warehouse/vendor should be considered to perform the warehouse activities. Additionally, the establishment of clear Service Level Agreements (SLA) is mandatory to achieve an efficient vendor management.</li>
                            <li>In the self-managed and third party-managed, it is highly recommended to implement an Inventory System that oversees the inventory management activities.</li>

                        <p class="normal-text">As stated in
                        previous sections, NaaS operators need to maintain certain Inventory elements
                        stored in stock as part of their deployment process. In particular, there are
                        two main questions that NaaS operator faces regarding the Inventory elements: </p>

                            operator order?</i> <br>
                            Large orders involve high average stock levels,
                            whereas small orders imply a high cost of placing multiple small orders. The
                            Economic Order Quantity provides guidance to address this issue. </li>
                            
                            <li><i>When should NaaS operators place an order?</i> <br>
                            The answer to these question depends on multiple
                            factors, among others, lead time to obtain the materials and supplier
                            reliability. Defining a Reorder Level helps in answering this question. </li>

                        <p class="normal-text">The goal of the
                        economic order quantity (EOQ) is to identify the optimal number of product
                        units to order that minimizes the total costs related to ordering, receiving,
                        and holding inventory. EOQ is an excellent approach to face the Inventory order
                        issues as it is flexible, easy to implement and provides guidelines for a wide
                        range of circumstances. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The materials
                        are delivered in batches from a supplier who delivers after a constant lead
                        time. Once stored, the materials are dispatched over the different sites and
                        the stock levels decrease. There is a point where new materials need to be
                        reordered to increase the stock level. Therefore, the stock levels within a
                        Warehouse follows a cycle with a saw-tooth pattern, as illustrated in Figure
                        14. </p>

                        the cost of keeping the materials in stock). The aim is to find the optimal

                        <p class="normal-text">Every time the
                        NaaS operator buys materials from suppliers, there is a lead time between
                        placing the order and having the materials arrive in stock. This is the time
                        the supplier takes to assemble the materials and prepare them for shipment, the
                        shipping time for the materials to arrive to NaaS Warehouse facilities and the
                        time to check the materials and put them into stock. Depending on different
                        circumstances, this lead time can vary between a few hours up to several
                        months. </p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Assuming that
                        the lead time (L) is constant, to ensure that a delivery arrives in time as stock
                        is running out, a new order must be placed a time L earlier. The most
                        straightforward method to find this point is to monitor the current stock and
                        place an order when the stock level just lasts the lead time. This means that
                        the order must be placed when the stock falls under a certain point called

                        organizations that maintain an excessive number of SKUs in their inventory.
                        This is mainly due to telecommunication materials like cabling, connectors and
                        ancillaries in general are not completely standardized. The high number of SKUs

                        <p class="normal-text">Logistics processes are crucial for a successful deployment in time and within the planned budget. If this process is delayed, the overall deployment time can be heavily impacted as it depends on materials readiness.</p>
                        <p class="normal-text">As mentioned before, the required time to move materials up to their final destination comprises different activities. The following are the most time-consuming activities that must be considered by NaaS operators:</p>

                        <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
                            <li><b>RFx and Purchase Order (PO) Generation Time:</b> In some cases, a new Product Order (PO) must be issued according to the Procurement procedures if the required elements are not available in stock.</li>
                            <li><b>Inbound Transportation:</b> Considers the required time to move materials up the NaaS operator warehouse facility. This step potentially includes international deliveries. The typical OEM delivery time is 12-14 weeks.</li>
                            <li><b>Warehouse Processes (e.g., Kitting):</b> Once the material arrives at Warehouse, a set of activities must be performed for materials management. The required time for these activities increases with the total volume of materials. Therefore, warehouse staff must be capable of performing these activities.</li>
                            <li><b>Outbound Transportation:</b> Considers the time to retrieve the materials from the NaaS Warehouse and move them to the respective RAN site location.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="normal-text">In some cases, especially in rural environments, the activities above might take several months to be completed. Therefore, NaaS operators must take into consideration the following general recommendations:</p>

                        <ul class="normal-text ul-iconos" style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
                            <li>Commercial activities (i.e., RFPs and PO) and related processes should start as soon as possible to avoid further delays on the deployment plan.</li>
                            <li>The end-to-end process should be streamlined and planned, ahead of schedule for a correct management of the deployment timeline. This is further addressed in the Deployment Management module.</li>

                        Inbound Processes </h3>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Inbound process
                        refers to the activities that bring the materials into the NaaS operator
                        Warehouse. Therefore, it includes all the tasks required to transport, store
                        and deliver materials from the different suppliers. Most of the time, NaaS
                        operators rely on the equipment vendor services for the Inbound Transportation,
                        limiting the management scope. However, certain activities need to be managed
                        in the inbound process.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Once the
                        materials arrive into the Warehouse facilities, they need to be checked on
                        cosmetics and other damages, shortages, surpluses, weights and measurements.
                        The materials documentation is also inspected, such as the waybill and invoice.
                        Incompleteness and/or incorrectness must be mentioned on the transportation
                        document or electronic device. In the case of damaged materials, it is required
                        to take pictures as evidence.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">All materials
                        must be inspected at arriving at the Warehouse, however, in case they cannot be
                        checked immediately, the inspection needs to be performed within 24 hours after
                        receipt and a notification will be sent to the supplier about the findings.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Each delivery is
                        normally pre-notified by email or other means. This is to inform the Warehouse
                        personnel that the materials are on transit, enabling them to plan resources
                        and processing instructions.</p>

                        <p class="normal-text">Outbound process
                        refers to the transportation, storage and delivery systems that bring materials
                        into the final RAN site locations. The outbound process starts when the
                        Deployment team issues a Work Order (WO), generally via email or directly into
                        the Warehouse Management System that keeps track of the materials.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">When the work
                        order arrives at the warehouse, the materials are picked, packed and shipped
                        based on their priority. The shipment process requires the availability of
                        basic information such as destination address, delivery schedule, number of
                        shipping units along with their weight and dimensions and priority type.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">Every shipment
                        needs to be packed in such a way that it can bear the travel from the warehouse
                        up to their final destination. The materials need to be properly packed to
                        absorb drops and falls during transportation. Moreover, each shipping unit
                        needs to be labeled with a tracking number so it can be scanned through the
                        transportation network for status updates via the service providers
                        track-and-trace system.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The shipping
                        waybill is a document containing details and instructions relating to the
                        shipment of materials. This document can be generated by handwritten,
                        standalone shipping systems or Internet-based tools. Each shipping unit needs
                        to be accompanied by the appropriate documentation.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">After the materials
                        have been picked and packed, it is a common practice that a pre-notification is
                        sent to the transportation service provider to pick up the materials. The
                        message contains information about the cargo (e.g. shipping units,
                        destinations, priorities) and a copy of the required documentation. The
                        pre-notification can be sent by phone, email, or a message in a specialized
                        system.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The delivery
                        vehicles commonly arrive one or half an hour before the departure time to check
                        and collect the goods. The actual time required to check the physical
                        conditions of materials and documentation depends mainly on the volume, but it
                        is also impacted by other elements such as type of materials, number of
                        destinations and loading process (manual vs automated). Transportation drivers
                        are expected to supervise warehouse personnel loading the goods and sign for
                        receipt.</p>
                        
                        <p class="normal-text">The delivery
                        vehicle departure times depend on the service providers transportation network
                        and transportation modes. It is recommended to contact service providers with a
                        late order cut-off time to give NaaS operators more time to drop orders for
                        same-day processing.</p>

                        delay, including the root cause, remedial action and a new Expected Time of
